before: i. e. before I could have brought you news of your son. —-
istuc, i. e. that my visit was inopportune.

94. illum adulescentulum, i. e. Philocrates, of whose escape Erg.
is supposed to be aware. [celox‚‘ nauigium modicum et breue, a
celeritate sic dictum· ‚ cf. Asin. 11 1. 10. '—Pareus.]

95. tuom Stalagmum seruom. This order of words, which at
first sight seems strange, is the usual one 3 50 tua Bromia ancilla,

Amph. v 1. 28, meus Mnesilochus filius, Bacch. 11 3. 112.
[97. Sancta Saturitas, cf. ὧν ὁ θεὸς ἡ κοιλία, Philippians 111 19.]

La 93. condecoret cognomine, ie, faciat ut dici possim Saturio.
m 111.

101. The fact that Κόρα (Proserpina) is at the same time the
name of a town in Latiiun (Cora), suggests to the parasite the idea
of going on swearing by the names of other towns in Latium,
Praeneste, Signia, Frusino, Alatrium, [all of which he makes
feminine, as though they were so many goddesses} [Schr'o'der

(ᾫΡ10311Ἰ1Ξ1Ξ11ΤἿΜ51151111511151,1853) suggests ναὶ τὰν Κόραν3 cf. Ar.
631)

[102. The reading of the MSS. Ι (m dia (‘ was it long since? ¹¹)
is quite out of place, for Erg. had a moment before said Tuom
modo Philopolemum uzdi (93). Heg. takes up the various p( 11115
of Erg.’s statement one by 01153 11515 115 should ask ‘Whaa
just now?' or something of that kind ; Wagner accordingly edn-
jectures tammodo, which seems to have been a provincialism for
modo, see Trin. 111 1. 8, ‘ T ammodo, inquit Pramzestinus 3 ’ and
Festus (p. 359, 5) says ‘tanwnodo antiqui ponebant pro modo!
Supposing Heg. to have used a provincialism, the answer of the
,Parasite ‘Yes, by Praeneste!' comes in with great effect: sec
Wagner in Jahn’s Jahrb. for 1866, p. 113. Tammodo, however,
scarcely suits the metre, as the final o would probably be short 3
and the word is far removed from the M SS.]

104. Barbaricas=lmlzcas, cf. 111 1. 32 and note. —quia enim
because, to be sur‚’e see note on 111 4. 36. *asperam i..e of
rough or harsh speech. [The Latin language is suppos sed to grate
upon the Greek ear. But apart from this, Plautus is very fond of
ridiculing the people of Praeneste, and especially their dialect· ,
see Truc. 111. 2. 23 (ut Praenestinis “ conia '' est ciconia). The
Praenestines seem to have held themselves aloof from intercourse
with Rome3 and in the year 216 B.c. (not so very long before the
Captivi was produced) refused to accept the offer of the Roman -
franchise (see Livy mu 20. 2). It is not surprising is. they were
unpopular]

105. uae aetati tuae, periphrasis for uae tibi. Vae is elided,
though an interjection.

106. Quippe, elliptica11y‚ ‘ Of course ill will betide me (nae mihi
erit), since you refu-se to believe what I say, and I have no chance
of my reward> for the good tidings.’—sedulo‚ ⁴ in good earnest-.’
