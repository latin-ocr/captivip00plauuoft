v 3. 12—4. S] NorEs, 125

referring to ist—istic, with ref. to 2nd person, ‘he whom you
have just mentioned, Paegnium)

12. nil Adv„ 311 emphatic nom—ceterum, ‘the rest,’ Obj. to
curma, as in Men. 1 4. 6 cetcrzmn cem-a.

14. argumenta, facts regarded as evidence. Rud. 1v 4. 136.

18. quom after eheu introduces the reason for the exclamation:
ί31331 that . . . .’ So Poen. 111 5. 46, alcea qaam 090 halma· ariolos
haruspices, Mil. lv 8. 47 hei mihi quom, Men. 11 2. 29.-—me‚ sc.
suem-e as in Aul. 111 2. 10 etiam restitus? αιι qaia minas quam
aequom erat feci ?

19. Quod is not a Conj., the sense being crucior propter id quod
male feci, see v 1. 21.—modo si, ‘if only,' nearly the same as
vtinam.

20. ornatus, alluding to the chains still on him ς cf. Ter. Adel. 176
ornatus esses ex tuis uirtutibus, and Rud. 111 4. 25 ita egso te him:
ornatum amittam, tu ipsus te ut non noum-is.

 

V. 4.
1. Acherunti, see on 111 5. 31.

2. nulla, the only passage in Plautus from which the gender of
Acheruns can be deterniined5 an older poet quoted in Cic. T usc. 11
16. 37 has altae Acheruntis [nulla A. is not so much ‘ no Acl1er0n‚’
as ‘ Ach. in no virise, in no degree ς’ cf. nullus eyoz‘ I don’t a bit,’
so totus eqoz‘ I wholly.']

3. 11110 ibi: the twofold designation of place <as of time in tum
ibi) is emphatic 3 Cic. pro Rosc. Am. 5. 13 hic ibidem. [Compare the
Eng. vulgarism ‘ that there.']

5. monerulae for monedulae3 so in the best MSS. both 11010
and in Asin. 111 3. 104.

[7. upupa, note the pun on the two meanings, that of the bird
(hoopoe) and that of 3 pickaxe].—delectem for μιῑεῑεοίανωη, from
metrical necessity, as in Pseud. 111 2. 6 noluit ut ess-ct qui mortuis
cenam coquat, Mil. 11 1. 53 qm· ad illum deferat, ut is huc

Ξεηίνὶι, (3123311204. 20 obseruauz't, quas ‘m α (lis haec puellam deferat;
mp . 11 . .

8. eccum, eccos, eccas, eccillum, missum, etc. (i.e. ecce eum, and
so on) 3 these words, in 3 sentence already provided with a finite
verb, are thrown in as interjections, and have no influcnce on the
construction ; so 111 the latter half of this verse, and in v 3. 203
see Cas. 11 1. 15 atque ea ipsa eccam effreditur foras, Rud. 111 2. 49
sed eccas ipsae huc eqrediuntur . . . . mulieres, Bacch. 1v 1. 39
Mnesilochus eccum maestus proqreditur sorae. We have eccum
incedit, eccum adest often used in this way, but never eccum est, a

simple cst being always omitted as in the former half of this verse,
and in Rud. lv 4. 130.
