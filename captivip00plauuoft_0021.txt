short vowel long by position ; hence such words as aqris, libros,
duplar, can never be scanned as spondees.

But it was Acoent that had the most extensive influence in
altering the natural quantity of syllables. While the delibe-
rate and stately language os oratory did full justice to the
length of the unaccented ending in such words as domi, cdii,
in spite of the accent on the short first syllable, in the more
hurried speech of every-day intercourse it was found tiresome
and inconvenient to follow up an accented short by an unac-
cented long syllable, and every iambic dissyllable was accord-
ingly weakened into a pyrrhic. Hence in the comic poets we

not unfrequently find such words as domi, preti, boni, boms,
soris (fores), manu, modo (abl), dedi, scanned as pyrrhics, nay,
iambic Imperatives are usually found with their last syllable
shortened‚ e. g. tene, vide, abi ,· whereas Ennius in such cases as
a rule restored the iambic scansion. We may express this in a
formula by saying that iamb = pyrrhic. The following instances
may be quoted froin Plautus and Terence: ηόυιῖ pictm'a (abl.)
Mostell. 1 3. 105, novo liberto Epid. V 2. 61, bonas ut aequomst
Stich. 1 2. 42, ίέυῖ sententia Ter. Hec. 111 1. 32, Ῐιένῐ ibid. 111
5. 16.

Side by side with this weakening of final vowels‚ and aris-
ing from the same cause, we find ’ a corresponding obscuration
of certain final consonants, as in the words enim, apud, quidem,
parum, soror, caput, amant, habent, for which the more ancient
inscriptions often show apa, quide, paru, ἕω* Consequently
the last syllable of such words, followed by a consonant, are
not necessarily long by position; thus, Ρνόεᾰί recedas Capt. ΙΙΙ
4. 19, pato‘r parerem Trin. 11 2. 39, decim mi ibid. IV 2. 57, apati

aliquid Poen. V 4. 50, soro‘r te ibid. 1 2. 87, erit cordolium ibid.
1 2. 89. That the weakening of the final sound in these words
is really due to the accent 011 the preceding short syllable, is
