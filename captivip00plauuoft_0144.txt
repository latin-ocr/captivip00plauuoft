132 EXCURSUS.

preserves the true reading, which Β has lost. Thus in 1 l. 15, J
has suco suo, B sno suco ,· in 11 1. 9, J cum catenis, B cnm catenatae,-
iu 11 1. 56, J potes, B potest ,· in 11 2. 19, J admutilabit, B admutila
labit,· in 11 3. 15, J ad parentes, Β adparentes meos ‚· in 11 3. 33, J
praecipias (written with a conti-action for prae), B¹precias‚ B2preci-
pc‘as; in all these passages J is not only clearly superior, but is
supported by the Codex Ursinianus <D)*, which has the same reading
111 each case (11 2. 19, D has adirzutalabit).

But further, J frequently has the superior reading, where Β and
D agree in an error. This will be seen from the following table ι

Prol. 36 is seruos hic seruus (B1)
,‚ 42 seruabit seruauit
1 2. 11 non uidere Noui dere (nouidere)†
1 2. 18 quippiam quipiam
1 2. 26 misera macritudine miser amacritudine
1 2. 46 dixti dixit
1 2. 68 Contentus Contemptus
1 2. 69 me assiduo meas si duo <meas siduo)
11 2. 16 intonstrina intostrinass (bitostrina)
11 3. 27 atque uiribus atque (atq.) auribus
11 3. 71 horum horunc
111 1. 7 nec cui minus nec qui minus
111 1. 13 cum ederint comederint (comederunt)

To these instances, which are all taken from the first 500 lines
of the Captivi, others could doubtless be added by any one pos-
sessed of a complete collation of D. 1 have noticed many other
passages where J is inferior to B,· the following instances are taken
from the latter half of the Captivi, which is not contained in D: in
1113. 6, J has Nec, Β Ne,· in 111 4. 32, J ,Male loqui mihi, B lisele
mihi loqui mihi,· in 111 4. 48, J has ei, which B omits,· in 111 4. 75,
J ainaim-i, easily recognizable as uinciri, Β uincire 3 in 111 5. 84, J
pcruiuo, D superuiuo ,· in 111 5. 108, J exauspicauz' ezuiuculis, which
words Β omits altogether 3 in lv 2. 20, J huius, B eiu->² ‚· in 1v 2. 21,
J is obstiterit, Β is extemplo obstiterit,· in lv 2. 107, J hinc, Β
Izic; in 1v 3. 4, J callo, B collo ,· in ιν 3. 8, J indempnatae‚ Β inde
nate ,· in IV. 4. 9, J εοὶζῇϊῃίΐ, Β confr-amit ,· v. l. 20 is misplaced in
B; in v, 2. 9, J has roborem, in which we can easily detect ruborem,
B ru.,zorem,· in v 2. 17, Jpotis es, B 27‹›1‘1'sses‚· in v 4. 6‚J aut
coturnices, B acoz‘nrm'ces. I have noticed a few isolated cases of a
superior spelling in J (e. g. Prol. 36, J seruos, B seruus).§

' By the kindness of Prof. Studemund I am enabled to bring the testimony of
D to bear upon many passages in which J differs from B: wherever D is quoted
in this Excursus, the reading has been eommunicated to me by him.

† The readings in brackets are those of D.

:t The syllable in is a correction (Scudcnrund).

ἓ It is ei rlous that in one or two passages J preserves a reading which originally
existed in B, but which has been corrected. Thus in 11 atio, Β has laudibus
where laudauit appears to have stood (S), and J reads laudauit. ln 111 4. 60,

the emme is probably the case, as the words Heus audin quid αιί qu- are a correc-
tion οἱ 15³ aiter erasure (S).
