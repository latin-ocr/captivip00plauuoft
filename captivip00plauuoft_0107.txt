11 2. 97—108] NOTES. 95

97. ex sententia. an attribute to seruos [‘ a slave after his mind '].

98. neque adeo, ‘nor indeed: ‘ and what is more, not,' cf. 111 3. 4,
Trin. 1 2. 144 ete—{hodie with a negative gives the idea of ‘ ever ς’
so Cas. 1v 1. 7 quin aycta's hodie ? . . . . Properate, and Hor. Sat. 11
7. 21 Non dices hodie, quorsum- haec tam putida tendant, ‘ Are you
never going to tell,‘ etc]

[933. ’For the hiatus, cf. line 81 and note. Br., after FL, transposes
engg.wi>1i}enio, ‘on his goodness of nature.'—me esse beneuolum,
‘that I mean well by him?

102. potest, impersonally.—cedere ad factum. If the reading is
right, these words must mean ‘ be carried out,' lit. ‘ should pass to
realization 3' [ef. the Eng. ‘ come to pass.’——-quam citissume . . . . tam
etc. For this construction, cf. Aul. 11 2. 60 quam ad probos propin-
quitate proxume tu adiunxeris, ram ‹mimam-st for quo propius, eo
melias, and see lVagner’s note, in which he refers to Ter. Haut. v 2.
44, Ad. 111 4. 56, Sallust. Jug. 31.]

103. Compare the similar¹ form of agreement in Amph. 11 2. 232.
Amph. szzqm'd cau-sam (licis, quin te hoc multem vectii-imonio?
Ale. Si deliqui, nulla causas& Amph. Conuenit. Trin. V 3. 13,
Aul. 11 2. 84, Pseud. 1 5. 119 (553), compare too Capt. 111 4. 92,
Cas. v 4. 30—32‚ Most. 11 2. 4.

104. soluite to the lorarii, who have remained on the stage from
the last scene, and stay till the end of the Act 3 for in the next scene
(line 96) slaves are again addressed.

105. atque, ‘aye, and what is more‚’ cf. 111 4. 53, Amph. 11 2. 133
dArnph. Quid nunc, mulier? audin illum? Alc. qu uero, ac falsum
acere.

106. quom . . . . honestas. WVhere the later usage of the language
eniploys the subj. with quom, thereby laying emphasis on the idea
of cause, Plaut. prefers to make the idea of time prominent by the
use of the indic. (especially the present indic.). Cist. 1 1. 116 sine
trahi, quom (‘ now that') eyomet trahor, Cas. 11 3. 16 sanus (sum)
quom ted amo, Capt. 11 1. 24, 11 2. 30, 11 3. 63, Most. v 2. 34, Men.
11 2. 30, v 2. 78. Even after praesertim. quom the indic. in Asin. 1 1.

Obs. 2.]

107. haud molestum est, ‘is not unpleasant‚' litotes—collus, cf. 1v
3. 2. Similarly φαίην is always masc. in Plaut. (accus. qntturem
Trin. 1v 3. 7); again hic dorsus Mil. 11 4. 44. On the other hand,

nasum (nent.) regularly, for nasus, cs. Men. 1 2. 57.

108. bena fit beneficium, see note on 84.—gratia ea, i.e. qratia eius
beneficii [cf. Virg. A. 11 171 Nec dubiis ea siqua (signs of that) (ledit
Tritonia monstris ,· so with hic, ibid. XII 463 hoc concussa metu (sear
of this), lv 237 hia· nas-tri nuntius· enm]
