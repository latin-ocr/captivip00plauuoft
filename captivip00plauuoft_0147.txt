APPENDIX.

Bentley’s emendations of Plautus are made upon the text of
Parcus* (2nd edition, Frankfurt, 1623, a re-issue of the 2nd edition
of Neustadt, 1619), and in ink of two distinctly different periods
and colours. The notes in fainter ink are far less frequent, occur-
ring chiefly at the foot of the page, and generally with the word leq.
(leyendum) or fo. (sortasse 2) or cm. (cm lamudam, cf. Pseud. 1 5. 144,
111 2. 92) before them, and are frequently identical with readings
also suggested in darker ink in the text and margin on the right aud
left of the page. It seems that Bentley made his first few correc-
tions at the foot of the page, and on a later and more complete study
repeated some of them among his matu rer thoughts in the margin.
Besides these emendations of the text, which are found in greater or
less number in all the plays, Bentley has added in the so-ealled first
eight eomedies the chief variants of the Codex Britannicus (J), to
which he generally appends the letters MS. 3 contrary, however, to
his usual wont, he nowhere states what MS. it is that he is collating.
In these eight plays all conjectural emendations are enclosed in
brackets with the word leq. In other plays he as a rule omits this
word, which is not necessary where there are no MS. readings from
which his corrections are to be distinguished.

Of these corrections the large majority are his own conjectures
though he draws frcely from previous editors and connnentators, and
does not indicate specially which of the corrections are taken from
them. But by no means all of Bentley's own conjectures are new
to the world at the present day ; many have been independently
made since his time by Lindemann, Bothed· Ritschl, Fleckeisen,
Brix and others: indeed, it is surprising to find how much of the
Plautino criticism of the present century is anticipated in this un-
known copy of Pal-eus. After deducting the corrections which helon g
to the two classes just mentioned, there romain a considerable
number which are entirely new and often of the highest value and
interest 5 it is precisely the inore recherche thoughts of Bentley
which others have not had the good fortune to light upon inde-

'' A few other emendations by Bentley, from his copy of Camerarius (Basle, 155S;
Brit. Mus. 682. c. 11), are added, p. 165.
