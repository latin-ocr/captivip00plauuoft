98 NOTES. [11 3. 44—62

[44-46, Here Tynd. is really speaking of himself, as also in 48
and 50-53 3 above (42) he reminds Phil. of the tender relationship
which had subsisted between them, here of his own past services,
and devotion to his master on the present occasion]

44. tamen is explained by the words in tanti->⁷ aermnnis, in which
there lies an implied concession. [Tamen is closely connected with
these words, though logically it must be taken with bene qessz'sse
morem. Similarly we find tamen sometimes attracted into the rela-
tive clause, eg. Lucr. v 1088 (coquntur) muta tamen cum sint uarias
emittere uoces, and 1v 106, cf. soph. O. C. 957 ἐρημία με, κεῖ δίκαι’
ὅμως λέγω, σμικρὸν τίθησιν.]

[45. te is accus. before infin„ me accus. after infin]

48. Numquam=n0ra Men. v 7. 23 Numquam te patiar perire.
[Compare the Eng. ‘N ever mind.']—gTatiis is always found as three
syllables in the comic poets‚ as shown by Bentley (on Ter. Ad. lv
7. 26). [Uss. considers that it may be here pronounced as two
syllables, and is thus able to keep emittat of the MSS. I have fol-
lowed Geppert and Lind. in reading qo'scte'z‘s mittat. No doubt mcum
emittere is the more common expression in the comic poets for the
later Ἠιαηηνηίΐίθφθ, as Br. says3 but in Curc. IV 2. 11 Β and J have
manu mittitis, for which we should probably read vnssttite‘s mama]

[52, 53. In these lines the speaker is really addressing himself to
Heg, to whom his statements might seem to need justification]

53. Quo pacto, ‘ and in this way!

54. The same mist-ake that is here found in Β] (ista for ita) is
made in A iu Epid. v 1. 16, Pseud. 11 2. 62.

[57. nam si seruos mi esses. Phil. humorously uses words which
bear an application to the real relation between himself and Tyndarus,
yet without exciting the suspicion of Hegio.—The next words (m'hflo
setius fuisti) must be regarded as an anacoluthon 3 instead of saying,
‘you would not have been more deferential,' the speaker substitutes
the equivalent, ‘you were not a whit less deferential' (imagine a
slight pause between protasis and apodosis). Such changes of con-
struction are common enough, especially in the free style of dialogue
(cf. Ter. Hec. 111 l. 6), and there seems iu this passage a special pro-
priety in the apodosis (suisti not faisses), which is intended to be
equivoeal, reminding the audience of the fact that Tyndarus really
had been as deferentia] as a slave. Brix conjectures nam qnasi seruos
meus sis, Ussing quasi semo-s· mens esses]

58. Di nostram fidem, not an appeal for help, but an exclamation
of surprise, like the Freuch ‘nm soi' [acc. of exclamation}

60. corde amare, so Truc. 1 2. 81.

[61. Seruos conlaudauit. This must have raised a laugh.]

62. quam, κατά σύνεσιν 3 haud centvm-sunnon partem -- multo minus,-

cf. Mil. 111 l. 167.
