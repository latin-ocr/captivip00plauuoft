7ss NOTES. [Pnot. 15—24

15. Qui potestis eenserier, i.e. those sitting near the stage, the
wealthy classes (the Senators aud Equites), as opposed to the capite
censi. [But ope sor opibus, ‘ wealth,' is unparalleled. In the Roman
thcatre the orchestra, being no longer occupied, as at AthenS, by the
Chorus, was reserved for the scats of the Senators. This arrange-
ment came into force ΒΟ. 194 (see Livy xxxiv 44. 5, and 54. 4-8 -
ul loca senatoria secernerent a populo. nam antece in ρνοφηῐεσῑιο sprc-
talmnt), and probably at some date between BC. 194 and EC. 67,
places near 1110 stage were also assigned to the Equites 3 sor Cicero
speaks of the law of Roscius Otho (67) as merely restoring to them
a right which they had possessed before 111 801110 shape (pro Murena,
§ 19. 40, equestri ordini restituit dignitatem).]

ome. The root idea 111 this expression was perhaps ‘ Ι do not dwell
upon (with affection).' Hence it was used (1) ozegyatively, 111 1110
801180 ‘ I am indifferent to' (eg. Virg. Aen. 11 365 et esse m'l moror,
‘ I care not if I am’) 3 (2) as an expression of positive (werslove, ‘ Ι
cannot bear,’ as in the above passage from Horace. Ι11 1110 English
‘ I do not care' there is a similar ambiguity]

17. dixeram may mean ‘had said,' i.e. at the time when Ι was
inter-rupted by the ‘ultumas’ (ll) 3 but perhaps it is here, as often
