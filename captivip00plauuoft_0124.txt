112 ΝΟΤΕΒ, [111 5. 36-82

Homeric metaphor δόλους καὶ μῆτιν ὑφαίνειν, and the Eng. ‘ a tissue
of lies.'—morti mittere, cf. Ἀϊδι προϊάπτειν, and Hor. Sat. 11 5. 49,
siquis casus puerum eyerz't Orco. Virg. A. 2. 85, demittere neci.

[36. Interdico, of the MSS. is simply a mistake caused by the
succeeding word]

38. adfore, sc. eum.

41. ad, cf. note on Prol. zie—bene est = καλῶς (εὖ) ἔχει, ‘ Ι am
glad of it ' 3 so Trin. 1 2. 14.

42. melius adaeque. The two distinct phrases, nemo aeque miser
and nemo miserior are here combined, for the sake of emphasis, just
as in Mero. 11 3. 1, homo me miserior mellus est aeque ,· cf. mayz's
certius, Capt. 111 4. 109.

45. Votuin, see 11 2. 14; but this was said to Philocrates.—
notare for uetare as often in Plaut.

50. custodem, ‘ companion.’

52. sorsum = seorsum.

[54. faxit. . . haberes3 for the unusual sequence of tenses,
cf. Mil. 1v 8. 46, si ita tibi sententia esset, tibi seruire mauelz'm
(converse order>.]

56. Essetne, for nonne essct.

58. Mihi, an iambus, cf. Prol. 46.

60. nuperus, ἅπ. eZp.—nouicius‚ a technical term for a newly-
purchased slave.

61. Τθ perdocere 3 for the acc. with inf. after postulare, cf. line
81, and Trin. 11 l. 15.

65. inde ibis porro, ‘ thence you will go on to.’—lat0mias lapidarias,
called in 78 lapicidinae ‚· in Poen. 1v 2. 5, we have the genuine
Roman form lautumiae.

67. cotidiano, adv. sor cotidie.

70. Perduis may mean either deso-031 or lose, Heg. ansxvem, ‘ Oh,
1 will take great care of him’ (ironically), as though Arist. had
meant to beseech him not to lose Tynd.

71. custodibitur, cf. on 111 4. 86.

72. interdius (again Most. 11 2. 14, etc.) is an old adv.=¹2'nterdz'u.
The form dius <‘by day ') appears in the derivative de'a1·-mcs,· cf.
nudius (in the phrases madias tertius, quartus, etc).

73. absoluam, ‘ let him off)

80. nequi (μήπως) as siqui (εἴτι-ως) ; qni is the ahl. of the indefi-
nite pronouu.—no deterius huic sit, ‘ that ho may not get a shorter

82. tuo periculo stat, lit. ‘ costs a risk to you ’ [cf. multo sanquine
ert Poenis victoria stetit, Livy xxm. 30. Tynd. means that Phil.
would avenge him}
