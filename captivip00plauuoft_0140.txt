traces of the fire are visible ; but this folio has suffered far less than
the average amount of damage, and therefore gives no idea of the
trouble which it costs to decipher the writing in some of the worst
places. Of the first folio, for instance (the commencement of the
Amphitruo), nothing remains but a small fragment of parchment
from the centre. The general character of the writing points to
the end of the llth century 3 our MS. is therefore probably some-
what younger than the Codex Vetus, and scmewhat older than the
Codex Ursinianus.

That so ancient a MS. could not be valueless was a priori probable;
and indeed no doubts as to its importance seem to have existed
among scholars until recent years, though it was at no time widely
known and apparently never collated. That Bentley both knew and
valued it, has been sufficiently proved in my Preface; if further
proof were needed, I might cite a passage from his edition of Terence
(Haut. 1 1. 20), in which he quotes a reading of a MS. which he
calls ‘ Codex Regius 800 annorum,' doubtless meaning J, which has
the reading in question* Our MS. appears, however, to have beon
known long before the time of Bentley. In his interesting article on
the ‘Plautine Studies of Camerarius' (Opusc. 111 p. 117), Ritschl
conjectures that J is the MS. which Camerarius hoped would be sent
to him from England. He quotes a letter of Melanchthon to Came-
rarius, June loth, 1538, from which it appears that the former had
been in correspondence with an English bishop on the subject.
“ De Plauto accurate scripsi ad Episcopum quendam Anglicum‚ et
ad Franciscum nostrum, qui cum tuo vetere amico Bammelbergio
in Britanniam missus est, ut audiant Regis voluntatem de religione.'’
It is supposed that the ‘Episcopus quidam Anglicus' was Thomas
Cranmer. Camerarius’ hopes were doubt-less disappointed 5 for his
‘Epistola Nuncupatoria’ makes no mention of his having received
the MS: had it actually been sent, he would certainly have cx-
pressed his obligations to the senders. But that J is the MS. in
question is sufficiently proved by the fact that there neither is nor
ever was, so far as is known, any other MS. of Plautus in England
which can date back farther than the l5th century.

Ritschl, too, was originally inclined, as has been stated above, to
place J upon an equality with B and D. His words are: “ex
illarum codice δ (the supposed archetype) repetendi Bet D, quorum
binas partes ex eis quae supra attulimus intelligitur seorsum scriptas
csse ι repetendus J, qui est membraneus Musei britannici 15. e-xl,
rectius autem ut opinor undecimo quam decimo saeculo tribuitur.”
With this passage should be compared his stemma, p. xxxvii. He
seemS, however, never to have seen the MS„ and to have had little
knowledge of it at this ti1ne; sor in the article quoted above (Opusc.
111 p. 119) 110 admits that hc has changed his opinion as to its import-
ance since receiving a collation of it by Eniil Rraun, and becoming
