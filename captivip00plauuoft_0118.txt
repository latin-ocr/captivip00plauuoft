18. Spitting was regarded as a charm against disease, and
especially epilepsy. Even at the present day among the common
people in Germany it is customary to spit, on the mention of
illness or missortune ; and spitting is regarded as an empiric
remedy 111 cases of ι1611611166. [Compare the habit 111 England of
spitting upon money “for luck.'⁷] But we have no mention in
ancient medical treatises of actually spitting upon the patient, as
here (lines 21, 23).—sputare morbum, ‘ to spit at the sight of <to
ward off) disease ' 3 hence qui sputatur morbus, ‘the disease at the
sight of which one spits.' [But perhaps qui is abl„ as Ussing says,
in which case qui sp. = ‘ 011 account of which one spits‘ In any
ease the disease meant is epilepsy, the ‘morbus comitialis’ (see
Ramsay, Antiq. p. 114), a case of which occurring at the Comitia
was regarded as so 01111110115 65 to put a stop to the proceedings.]
