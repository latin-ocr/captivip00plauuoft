11 3. 22—43] NOTES. 97

following other compounds in PL, abz'tere Epid. 11 2. 121, Rud. 111
4. 72, 111 5. 35, adbitere Capt. 111 4. ’ἴ 2, inter-bitere Most. v 1. 47,

ρεξόίὲιέᾞ = perire Pseud. 111 l. 12, Rud. 11 6. 11, praeterbitere Poen.
v . .

22. pater, i.e. ‘ your father 5' but there is an intentional ambiguity
in the word—[aliquem = alium quem, as in Virg. Aen. 11 48 aut ali-
quis latet erroru]

25. The longer and weightier trochaic septenarii introduce a pas-

sage of deeper feeling, the valeslz'ctz'o or parting—[adhuc locorum,
cf. inde loci Lacr. v 789]

26. in rem conducat = ex re sit.

[27. Ι have adopted the excellent emendation of Brix ; something
like semper seems to be demanded by adhuc locorum of 25, and this
would hardly be conveyed by persequar. ΒΓ. tells us that there is
the same corruption of the text in Cas. 1 1. 5 quoquo ibis tu te per-
sequi, where A only preserves the right reading quoquo ta ibis te
semper sequa]

32. honore honestiorem, cf. on 11 1. 54. [The phrase is intention-
ally ambiguous. Tynd. means ‘Hegio treats me as a master, whereas
I am really a slave.’]

33. ne praecipias, a prohibition (ne is not ‘ lest') ; cf. on 11 2. 81.
—memoria memini, cf. on 11 1. 54.—tamen [⁶ all the same’] at the end

of the line and the thought 3 cf. line 44 and 1 2. 78. So Amph.
1 3. 44 ut quom absim me ames, me tuam absentem tamen.

[35. cum hoc with hiatus, cf. Prol. 24.]

36. mora morast, ‘ would be sheer waste of time,' cf. 1v 3. 6. [For
est cf. the phrases lorcyum est enmnerare, dicere, etc.]

37. uicem, an adverbial accusative, connected in Pl. with a posses-
sive pronoun or genitive: ‘in place of us both,’ cf. en· uicem 111 3.
ll, uocis uicem Amph. 1 1. 181, meam uicem Most. 11 1. 8.

38. utrique is here prob. genitive ,- as also in Aul. 11 1. 10 3 comp.
Pers. 111 1. 14 in uentris rem uidebitur, and Ter. Hcc. 1 2. 27.—
[Poteris of the MSS. is probably an unskilful attempt to avoid the
hiatus after primum, and makes the line too long. Lind. as well as
Bent. strike it ou't. Gepp. reads poterit stae, and refers to Lachmann
on Lucr. p. 197.

41. The bracketed words must be considered to be a clumsy inter-
polation on account of the repetition (me hic ualere 31), the meaning-

leshsc thtitheSis et tate, and the word audacter, which is quite out of
p e ere.

43 The reading of the MSS. me ad. tibi cannot be right, as te is
required in the next line as acc. before the inf. yesszzase. [The mis-
take may have easily crept in, owing to a confusion in the mind of
some copyist,]who forgot that Tynd. is here speaking in the charac-
ter of master.
