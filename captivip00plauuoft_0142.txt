130 EXGURSUS.

detectcd. But the passage on which WVagner laid chief sti-ess, the'
line (Aul. 241, XVagn.)‚

ni mirum occidor, nisi ego intro huc propere propero currere,

in which the word propere is omitted in J, admits, he thinks,
of another and simpler interpretation. This line, which is really a
trochaic septenarius, is misplaced in all the MSS„ which give it
after 390 (11 8. 23) among iambic senarii 3 and Wagner considers
that the coypist of J omitted the word propere in order to make it
scan as a senarius. But, Go'tz retorts, the verse will not scan even
so, unless nisi be also changed to m'; what then is more likely
than that propere was simply an accidental omission before the
similar word propero? The opinion which Go'tz himself has of J
may be summed up in the statements, that it belongs to a family
the common source of which must be referred to the same archetype
from which B and D sprang; and that accordingly, while J cannot
be neglected in those plays which are contained in D, its importance
where D fails us and J is left as the only MS. that can be set by
the side of Β, is exceedingly great. He adds that the chief reason
of the inferiority of J to B is, that the former was the work of a
very careless scribe (“ quod a librario saepissime dormitante scriptus
est''). This position he supports by quoting a number of lines from
the Epidicus, in which J helps to restore the true reading against a
mistake of B ; and in several of them he shows that the reading of
J agrees with the Ambrosian palimpsest (A).

I now proceed to discuss the verses quoted above from the last
folio of J, which I translate as follows : ‘ An imperfect copy (arche-
type) at length drove me after too long delay to make this copy÷÷
of Plautus with my own hand, in order that an ignorant scribe might
not add imperfections of his own to those he found (there), and
this book be sc less faithful than its unfaithful original.’ If this be
the meaning, there is no hint of correcting or einending the faulty
archetype 3 the emphasis is on the word spszcnz, ancl the writer adds
that his motive in copying the original with his own hand was, that
the duty might not fall to one whose imperfect knowledge might
lead him still further to pervcrt the faulty archetype. This imper-
fect knowledge would just show itsclf in the attempt to improve
upon corrupt readings: if pamnplarier meant ‘to emend,' the last
two lines would lay the writer open to a very easy retorti* AIendum
