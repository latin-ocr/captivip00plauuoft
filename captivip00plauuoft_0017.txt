INTROD UCTION. 5

mitted in the faithful discharge of his duty to his master.
Hegio, whose one feeling is now a thirst for vengeame, orders
him to be cast into chains and carried off to the stone quarries.
The change brought about in Hegio by the ingratitude of
those whom he had treated with kindness, is very well drawn.
He is of an impulsive nature, and wholly dominated by the
feeling of the moment.

ACT ΙΙΙ.

Scene 1 (lv 1). The gloom that settled upon the last Act
is soon to be dispelled. Ergasilus enters jubilant from the
hai-bour, blesses Heaven for a great change in his own pros-
pects‚ and announces that he is the bearer of good news for
Hegio. “

Scene 2 (IV 2). Enter Hegio, dejected and irritable. Over-
hearing the Parasite’s exuberant expressions of triumph, he
supposes him to have dined. then Ergasilus sees Hegio, he
grasps him by the hand, and bids him give immediate and
extensive orders for a dinner, the items of which he enume-
rates. At last he takes pity upon the mystification of Hegio
and tells him what the news is; he has seen Philopolemus
land at the harbour in company with Philocrates and the run-
away slave, Stalagmus* Hegio is at first incredulous, but the

‘¹‘ 111 Lessing’s “ Kritik iiber die Gefangenen von Plautus,” the question
is discussed whether this speedy return of Philocrates is not a violation
of the unity of time. That a journey from Aetolia to Elis and back could
not actually be performed in the short time which would ela1 se between
the end of the first and beginning of the third Act, is an objection which
has no validity; for the poet has a perfect right to postulate the lapse of
any amount of time between two Acts of his drama. So there would be
no difficulty in accepting the account, taken by itself, of the snfferings os
Tyndarus in the stone quarry‚ all of which he underwent between the
end of the second and middle of the third Act (see above). But that
these events should have been transacted while the Parasite was waiting]
sor his dinner, a prominent feature in the drama, is an inconsistency—the
one set of facts cannot be reconciled with the other, and a sense of incon-
gruity is forced upon the audience. It is true that Aetolia and Elis are
merely names standing for two countries at war, and the postulate of a
much less than the actual distance between them is again quite legiti-
mate; but however much we stretch this plea, the shorter jonrney that
remam-5, together with the events that huppen in Elis, demand a much
