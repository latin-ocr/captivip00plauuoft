This MS„ which scholars have agreed since Bitschl to designate

v by the letter J, is at present little known, and its value a dehated

question. Ritschl, in his Prolegomena to the Trinummus, p. xli
(1848), accorded it an equal rank with the Codex Vetus (B);
Xl'agner, who first published a collation, for his edition of the
Aulularia (1866), expressed an adverse opinion, and challenged the
position which Ritschl had assigned it in his stemma. Since
Wagner's Aulularia was published, several writers have discussed
the question, and arrived at various results. I propose to give
some account of this controversy, and to state the conclusion
to which Ι have been led from a consideration of the arguments
advanced on both sides, and my own examination of the MS.

For a description of J and its history I will refer the reader to
VVagner's Introduc-stom* to which the following remarks may be
regarded as supplementary. It is neatly executed, apparently by
more than one hand 3 few contractions are employed, and the writ-
ing is on the whole easy to read, exceptiug where it has been
damaged by the fire. It has, however, been so severely burnt all
round the edge, that nearly the whole of the margin is destroyed,
and the beginnings of lines on the left, and ends of lines on the
right hand pages, and sometimes a line or two at the tops of pages,
are more or less illegible. The MS. thus injured has been re·
paired or inlaid, the parts destroyed having been replaced by new
parchment, so as to complete the original size of the pages, and to
preserve the whole from further inj ury.

The facsimile specimen, containing a passage from Capt. 111 l, is
taken from the bottom of a folio, and will serve to give some idea of
the appearance of the MS. : the heading of the new scene is in red
letters, and also the capital letter M. On the right hand side the

⁴* 1 would at the same time point out a slight mistake into which wagner has
fallen. The quotation which he gives from Casley (p. 316), to the effeot that the
MS. ‘was preserved,’ refers to an entirely different volume—one in the Cottonian
Library. There can be no doubt that our MS. was injured in the fire which burut
the cotwnian and part of the Royal Libum-y (Oct. 23, 1731). The MS. bears
every appearance of having suffered by fire; and Casley's words, ‘lacerata sunt
aliqua folia in principio codicis) apply sufficiently well to it, being intended to
mark the different state of preservation of the beginning and end of the book. All
Caeley’s descriptione are eomes-hat vague and general.
