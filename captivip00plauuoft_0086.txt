74 NOTES. [Aac. 8—rnor.. 8

[but the conj. is in Fi’s text is feeble. Notice‚ too, the unusual
sequence os tenses]

8. 18, Philocrates.
9. Indicio quoius, i. e. fugitivi—alium, Tyndarum. [The order of
words (ind. quoi.) is not Plautina]

Pammene—1. hos, attracted to the case of qnos [cf. Virg. Aen.
1 573 urbem quam statuo uestra est] and resumed by the hi which
follows, as istos 1 2. l by his. [In such cases, the speaker proceeds,
as it were, tentatively in constructing his sentence, instead of con-
sciously realizing it as a whole from the first, and thus a noun,
placed early for the sake of emphasis, easily falls under the influence
of the verb that immediately follows it.]—sta1·e. Although the pri-
soners do not take any part in the action of the piece until the
beginning of the second Act, they are present in chains 011 the pro-
scenium during the delivery of the Prologue. This would give the
audience an opportunity of getting to know their faces and dress, and
so avoiding confusion in the sequel.

[2. Evidently a joke, παρὰ προσδοκίαν (cf. Trin. 111 2. 97, and
Wagner's note). But the reading Illi of the MSS. is corrupt and
makes no sense, for the same persons could not be called H ἰ 111 one
line and Ι 1Ζί 111 the next, the word has been explained by some as
meaning ‘ there’ (illic), but this is not consistent with hic in the line
before. Fleckeisen proposes I'incti qnia, which cannot be said to be
probable.—ast0 is used in its proper sense of ‘to stand doing nothing,
idle' (‘stand expectant’ is often more exact, cf. Virg. Aen. 11 303,
arrectis auribus mlst‹1).]

[4. senex qui hie habitat, modelled on 1 1. 28]

5. suo sibi. This expression, which occurs again 21 and ῐ 1, 13,
is equivalent to sm) ipse ,· sila? does not depend on the verb, but must
be taken closely with seco in the sense of ‘his own.' [The phrase
cannot be analyzed grannnatically 3 it is rather one of those combi-
nations calculated to produce an effect on the car. Plautus uses it
again Trin. 1 2. 119 reddum suom> sihi, where however sibi has inore
‘raison ‹1'et1·e‚’ as a dative is required after reddum, and sibi repre-
sents ei as well. So in the single instance from Cicero (Phil. 11 37.
96 priusquam tu suum sibi venderes, ipse possedit), suum sihi stands
also in a close relation to ipsc possedit. But the passage above men—
tioned and Ter. Ad. v 8. 35 sno sim· {fludio hanc J'etgsnlo‚ are more
difficult to justify, cf. Amph. 1 1. 116.]

6. operam dare, properly ‘to be at any one's service‚' often in the
comio poet< in the special sense of ‘to give one's attention,' ef. 54,
111 4. δι’), Triu. Prol. 5.

[8. Alterum, to bc pronounced with syncope, altrum. The same
pronunciation is necessary to scau Pers. 11 2. 44 ε thus dextera, (11.1·-
{mam-snm, ulterior, ultro, exist side by side; cf. surpuit for surripuit.
—Thc line is borrowed from 111 5. 1023 cf. 011 Arg. 2.]
