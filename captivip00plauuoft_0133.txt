ιν 3. 8-4. 12] NoTES. 121

Erg speaks of himself as such a governor, cf. Cas. 1 11, quin ruri
es in praefectura tua ἲ (of a ‘ vilicus ’). [The restoration of this verse
is due to Geppert, who discovered traces of the lost words in the
Ambrosian Palimpsest]

[8. indemnatae“ quasi rei, qui indemnata causa suspensi iudicium
expectentss’ Uss. ]

 

IV. 4.

[The grammarians and editors who divided the play into five acts
ought clearly to have begun the fifth here, and not aj‘ter this scene.
For some considerable interval os time is necessary, if the account
given by the boy in lines 6-10 of the doings of Erg. is not to
appear grossly improbable 3 whereas no pause is needed at the end of
this soene. But it would be better to give up the division into five
acts altogether.]

[4. This line lacks some syllables ; but all the conjectures hitherto
proposed seem liable to serious objections. Lind. supplies si sit
after quasi, but the present is the wrong tense ; C. Rothe (Quaest.
Gramm. p. 36, Berlin, 1876) proposes esset ‚· but in such expressions,
as Br. remarks, it is not the custom of Plaut. to use the verb esse at
all, cf. Poen. v 2. 74 qnasi proserpens hes-tica]

[5. The fragment of this verse, which Geppert has been able
to read in the Ambrosian M S.‚ is found nowhere else. I have given
his conjectural restoration in the text ; but it need hardly be said
that the reading cannot be considered certain]

7. deturbauit, ‘ he pulled down meat hook and all‚’ instead of
cutting off a portion of what was hanging on it.

8. glandium, a glandule of the throat 5 the ylandulae in a pig are
what the tonsillae are in a man.

10. seriae, ‘ preserving pans ;’ the saucepans he did not consider
large enough for his purpose. [The scansion coeam per. is defended
by Miiller Pl, Pros. p. 93. At the beginning of the verse some
licence is allowed5 see Christ, Metrik, ξ 400, cf. § 346.]

11. omnes, for there were several, e.g. olearia, uinaria, penaria.—
reclusit. The long syll. re· is to be explained from the old form of
the prefix red· (as in redimere, redire, redz'nteffl·c17·e, reddere, etc.) 3 the
forms redcludo, redcz'do became first, by assimilation of the consonants,
reccludt), reccido (redduco required no change), then, wit-h a long
vowel to compensate for the loss of a consonant, recludo, recido,
reduco, and finally with a short vowel, recludo, recido, reduco.

13. sibi, an iambus see on v 1. 19.—Construe: si quidem uolet
sese uti sc. penu.

[14. The verse is unmetrical as it stands ιιι the MSS„ · adopting
Lind' s correction, we musto scan nam without elision. —iam erit,
for iam with the future cf. Aul. 11 2. 26, z cm ad {c rmum]
