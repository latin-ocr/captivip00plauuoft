INTRODUCTMX. 1 1

with emphasis, neglected to give the preceding long but unac-
cented syllable its due weight. We may express this again in
a formula, thus : bacchius = anapaest. To such popular pronun-
ciation, then, correspond scansions like the following: senectzzti

dmm Most. 111 2. 88 ; and in equivalent combinations such as,
pm· &andnam Stich. 11 1. 25, in &walto Capt. Ι 1. 15, ubi &occisio
Pers. ΙΙ 3. 19, aye ἄόῑῖάο Stich. 111 1. 17, ita at dicis Capt. 1 2. 15,

These instances may suffice to give an idea both of the
extent and the limit of the influence which accent may exert
in shortening long syllables, the limit being that the shortened
syllable must stand immediately after a short one, and either
before 01· after 0110 upon which falls the accent in prose 01 1110
ictus in verse; on the other hand, we may observe that 1110 short-
ening affects syllables long both by nature and position, and
111 1110 latter case can override not merely two, but even three
consonants. Thus 1110 first syllables of inter, omnes, ipse, hercle,
iste, hac, haec, &c.‚ are in themselves just as decidedly long as
those in summus, credo, sic, nime, and so forth; but 111 1110 two
combinations qaid >linter and quid tuear* they are reduced to
shorts by the rhythm of speech or metre.

Further‚ we are in possession of a few isolated facts which
make it probable 11101 1110 weakening of quantity in certain
cases found a corresponding expression in spelling. Thus the
scansion in 6culto is supported by the spelling with a single c
of one MS. (the Decurtatus) in Trin. 111 2. 38, 86; and again
We may compare simulam with the spelling facilumecl in the
senatus cons. de Bacch. ; in the words omittere, operire, aperire,

'¹' These shortenings produce the same rhythmic effect that 13 created
in music by a grace note before an accented (loud) or unaccented (weak)
beat. As in music the grace 11010 and accented crotchet are compressed
into the time of a single beat, so the syllables quidint (a short and a long)
combine and together form a single long.
