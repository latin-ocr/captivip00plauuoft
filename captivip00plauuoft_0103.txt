11 2. 20—40] NOTES. 91

20. Hegio wishes to give the Pseudotyndarus a hint that his
emancipation may depend on the frankness of his avowal.—-memora.
:dit-.- [cf. M asa milti causas memora, Aen. 1 l. 8].

21. longissume, i. e. absit.
22. seruitus, in Elis, under the father of Philocrates.

23. familiaris filius,‘ sou of the house ;' cf. pater, mater familias,-
also filius familias, Cic. pro Coel. 15. 36. [N otice the equivocation
in this]statcment of Phil, which is literally true, though it deceives
Hegio.

24. Thales proverbially for a wise man, in Bacch. 1 2. 14, Rud. 1v
3. 75, Aristophanes Nub. 180, τί δῆτ’ ἐκεῖνον τὸν Θαλῆν θαυμάζομεν.
—talento; we should expect a smaller sum, but talentum serves the
purpose of a pun on Thales.

25. ad sapientiam; w] gives the standard by which two things are
compared, ef. Cic. De Or. 11 6. 25 quem cofflzouz'nms airam bonum
et litteratum, scd nillil ad Persium ; so πρός.

26. contulit, 1101 ‘ has turned the conversation on to‚' for this Hegio

had done ς but ⁴ adapted his language 10,’ i. e. so spoken as though
he had really been a slave.

27. Polyplusio‚ ‘the family of the Goldfieldsss

28. illi=z‘ll2'c, as in 73, 84, 91, as isti sometimes=2ssst2·c.--unum
pollens atque honoratissimum, ‘powersul and respected above all
others.' So Amph. 11 2. 54 quam omnium Thebis· zcz'r atzam esse op-
tumam (I ι’ 1⁶an icat.

29. ab, i. e. qui proficiscitur ab summis uiris.
31. sebum: he takes opimae in its original and material sense.—

senex, the father of Philocrates, the mention of whom occasions the
next question.

32. abimus; for the present ef. on Prol. 24.

35. Thensaurochrysonicochrysides. Perhaps we should read this
phantastic name Thensaurocroesonicochrysides (lit. son of gold, that
outdoes the treasuries of Croesus). As it stands, it means ‘ that out-

does treasuries of gold.’
36. quasi, with propter diuitias ‘so to speak.'

[38. Brix thinks this line a gloss, on the ground that in 111 4. 102
Hegio hears the real narne Theodoromedes sor the first time. It mv
possibly, as Geppert thinks, be an ‘ aS1de’ to the audianus]

39. quid tu ais? as in Trin. 1 2. 156 Sed quid ais? to introduce
another question, ‘ that do you say to what 1 am going 10 ask you ‘l’
Eng. ⁴ Hark you.' pertinax here humourously = perquam tenax.

40. ut magis noscas, i. e. ‘ Ι will just tell you one fact about him,
in order thatlv ete—quando = aliquando ; so in the phrase si quando

‘if st any time.’
G 2
