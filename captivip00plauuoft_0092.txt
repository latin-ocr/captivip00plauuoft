80 NOTES. [1 1. 2-22

2. inuocatus, ‘an uninvited guest.’

3. derisores, ‘ wags‚' i.e. other parasites, who did not approve of the
wittieism at the expense of one of their class.——[absurde‚ ‘flat‚' ‘out
of place ,³ ef. vax absona et absurda Cic. de Or. 111 11. 41.]

[4. Erg. however does not mind finding a new meaning in this
jest at his own expense]

5. sibi inuocat, ‘invokes’ It was a Greek custom when casting
dice to call upon the name of some deity or one’s mistress for luck ;
for an example see Cure. 11 3. 75 seq. [The MSS. here repeat scortum .·
Ι have followed G. G'otz and Brix in caneelling the word aud putting
sihi from the beginning of the line in its place]

[6. The sem-tum therefosre is ‘invoked‚' ‘pledged in drinking‚’ at
the banquet]

7. Verum hercle uero, again Cure. 111 53 and in the same sense
we have uerum enim uero Capt. v 4. :Ze—planius, i. (ἥψω-ε ob&
viously inuocati. Ι·

S. inuocat, i. e. in the sense of line 5.

9. The parasite Saturio uses the same simile of himself and his
tribe, Persa 1 2. 6.

10. res prolatae sunt, ‘public business is suspended' (lit. ‘is put
off ⁷ till a later date), as sometimes happened in time of war or on

account of public games or excessive heat of weather. A Roman
allusion, see on 22, and cf. 30 seq.‚ 1 2. 2, 1 2. 44—55.

12. quasi z sicat, and to be joined with lactent and canona—caletur
impersonally for calet, so Truc. 1 1. 46.

15. in occulto, see Introd. A (ii) and (iv).
16. rurant z rastc‘gctntnr. .

17. uenatici canes, because equally leanffi

18. redierunt, sc. res, the opposite of prolatae smm- so in Cic. it
is a regular business exp1·essi0n.—Molossici‚ odiosici, ineommodestici,
are words humorously formed (from Molossi, odiosi, 1'1oe‹›mm‹u.li) with
the same termination as υωιαΐίεί, as though they were all different
breeds of (legs. [The canis ,Molossus (Hor. Epod. 6. 5> was a large
breed from Epirus, osten employed as house dugs, and hence lead-
ing a protectcd‚ well-to-do life]

20. [hic, adv.]—potis, i.e. poti->- est = potest. So Trin. 11 2. 75 pote
for pote ω· πρωίας. [Fotis is thoroughly Plautinc; but potest would
be supported by J.]

21. frangique in caput. So Saturio in Persa 1 2. 8 coynomentum
erat duris cupitonilms.——aula the only form in Pl. for olla.

22. The reading in the text is Fl.’s emendation. Ire <after nel)
and licet os the MSS. are probably a gloss upon ilia-vt, which has
crept into the text.—-portam Trigeminam. The scene is in Aetolia ς
