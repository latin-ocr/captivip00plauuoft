NOTES.

ARGUMEw.—-It is Ritschl’s opinion (Proleg. Trin. p. 317) that
all the argumenta prefixed to Plautus' Plays belong to the second.
century after Christ ; whereas Teuffel and Seyffert hold that the
acrosties, the great majority, were written during the seventh cent.

A.V.C., i. e. about 100 years after the death of Plaut.

[1. in pugna, with hiatus in the caesura of the iainbic senarius. In
this instance there is a special justification sor the hiatus in the fact
that it occurs before α proper ncmw, which is made more prominent
and distinct when it is entirely severed in pronunciation both from
the word that- precedes and that which follows. Even Ritschl (Pro-
leg. Trin. p. 204 sol.) conceded the hiatus with proper names in two
passages; so Hegio with hiatus again in 111 4. 73, v 4. 273 on the
other hand, with elision in 1 2. 77, 111 4. 86.]

2. alium for alteram, and again amittatur (7) for amitteretur (cf
however Mil. 11 1. 53), as well as the whole structure of the acrostic,
betray the shackles under which the composer was labouring. [The
line is a reminisceuce of 111 5. 102]

3. Aleos, seo on Prol. 9. [Borrowed from 1 1. 32]

4. gnatum captum, i.e. Philopolemus, ef. v. 1.

5. [inibi, the reading author-ized by the MSS„ means here ‘among
them‚’ cf. the Eng. ‘therein.' So Aul. Gell. xvn 8 Frequens cius
cenae fundus etfirmanwutum omne erat (mla mm lentis Aegsgsl›t1'‹ce et
cucurbitae inibi minutim caesae. So with other adverbs, eg. unde
(from whom) nil maja-3 (feneratur ipso Hor. Od. 1 12. 17 : the hiatus
after the second thesis need not cause any difficulty, especially in one
of the Argumenta Acrosticha‚ when we remember their probable
authorship. Most editors accept the conjecture ιή ihm, an old Latin
form with the termination of the 3rd decl. τοῖς. In favour of this
it might be pleaded that the writers of the Arguments and Prologues
undoubtedly aimed at imitating the language and prosody of l'lautus;
thus in this acrostic the form CAP'rmvm (cf. however Amph. Arg.
1 3 Alcmena, whereas Plautus always has Alcmena, four syllables).]
—amissum Tyndarus (Paegnium, v 3. 7).

6. uorsa, i.e. changed.

7. amittetur in the sense of clt'mittatnr, as often in Plautus, e. g.
Mil. ιν 3. 3, Most. 11 2. 2, Men. v 8. 6.—ut amittatur, i.e. ιιι ‹lemti-

mcs ιιηι. We should expect a more explicit antithesis (nt ille am),
