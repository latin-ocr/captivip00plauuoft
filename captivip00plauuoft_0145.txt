Exec'lews. 133

In the latter instanccs we may sasely pronounce J superior, with-
out the support of D. Who then can deny the importancc of J in
those parts of Plautus in which it is the only means of eontrolling
B Ἰ So far from its being true, as the reviewer in the Philologiseher
Anzeiger says, that, in the absence of the support of D, a reading of
J carries scarcely any authority, it appears that it is precisely in
these cases that the importance of J is greatest; though of course
it would come with even more authority if supported by D.

On the other hand, there arc liniits to the claims of J. On the
wli« l ·‚ the passages in which help is given by J are those in which
the corruption in B is not very serious. If we compare these pas-
sages with some of those in which A throws a flood of light upon a.
hopelessly corrupt passage in B, we see at once the immeasur.·l›lc
distance which separates the two cases 3 whereas in passages in which
B presents a deep—seated corruption, J (and Ι may add D) usually
gives no help. The following references may serve as instances:
Prol. 22, 58, 1 1. 17, 1 1. 34—39, 11 l. 7, 111 1. 19, v 1. 7. These
identical errors must be ascribed to the common archetype of Bl)
and J, and prove eonelusively the close relation in which they all
three stand to one another. We must accordingly not expect from
J the sort of help that comes from a MS. representing an altogether
older tradition, such as A ; but the help given by J is similar and
equal to the help given by D. From a comparison of B with D and
J, we may sometimes be able to inser the reading of their common
archetype (ὃ), which, is we possessed it, would perhaps be of equ-al
value with A.

It remains briefly to consider the question of the siinilarity of J
to the later MSS„ upon which an indictment against the former has
been founded. This similarity is in general, no doubt, striking ; but
it in nowise diminishes the authority of J, the only legitimate infer-
ence being that all these MSS. belong to the sanie family.qe Accord-
ingly, where they contain a reading superior to B, the agreement
of J simply lends the authority of age to the reading of the later
MSS. It is doubtless true that, owing to this close relation, early
editors were in many passages enabled to correct the reading of B
from the minor MSS„ independently of the help of J ; but this does
not really detraet from the value of a MS. of the llth century,†
though I venture to think that it has been one of the causes why J

⁵ Positive evidence bas recently been produced by G'otz of the existence of two
older MSS. of the family of J: (1) a MS. of somewhat earlier (late than the llth
century, of which a fragment only (Capt. 11 3. 40—111 4. 2⁴2) has been preserved
in the Codex ottobonianus (see Anal. Plaut. pp. 86, 87); this fragmffint exhibits a
great similarity to J both in its readings (see effractum, 111 1. 6, for ecfertum) and
in the contractioris and spelling employed, though enclitics and procltiies are not
so frequently joined to their respective words as in J; (2) a MS. of the lsstb cen—
tury (E), now in the Ambrosian Library, containing the first eight plays, and
presenting a close resemblance to J, though clearly not copied from it (see an article
by thz and Lowe in the Rheinisches Museum for 1879, p. 52).

† For example, the reading which J preserves in 111 5. 108 and ιιι 2. 13 is not
any less valuable because other and later Mss. also preserve it.
