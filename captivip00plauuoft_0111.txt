11 3. 64—74] Noms. 99

64. occasio cumulare for cumulandi, as in Pers. 1v 7. 15, Cure. 1 1.
60, Poen. 111 3. 46, v 4. 56 3 see note on 11 2. ‘cz—ut, ‘in such a way
as to act,' i.e. ‘by acting,' so 111 1. 26, Pers. 1 1. 38 To. Facere ami-
cum tibi me potis es sempz'ternmn. Sa. Quem ad modam? To. Ut
mihi des nummos sescentos [cf. Ovid Fasti, Ι l. 307 sie. . . . non αἱ]

65. magis belongs to uelle, non to possam, cf. 111 4. 46.—opera,
‘ in deed‚’ so Trin. 1v 1. 7 [cf. ἔργῳ], ‘ my wish to see it done cannot
be greater than will be my earnest endeavour to bring it about!

[66. The MSS. read do for laudo, which leaves the verse too short.
Laudo is from the grammarian Nonius, who says (p. 335, s.v. laa-
dare) ‘ Laudare est verbis ecferre . . . . Plantas Captiuis: id ut scias,
Jouem supremam testem lamlo E91'0.' The change of lando into do
isjust such a one as a copyist, who did not understand the expression,
might have made. Brix and F leck. supply tibi after da]

[67. That is, ‘I will be faithful to myself,' as the audience would
not fail to see]

[68. quam memet, prop. qnam ipse, but attracted into the accus„ cf·
Cic. Cat. M. 1 Suspicor te eisdem rebus, quibas me ipsam, commoneri]

[69—85. There is a double meaning running through the whole
of this passage 3 while seeming to exhort his slave not to run away,
he is really addressing a passionate entreaty to his master not to be
ungrateful (fidelis sisfideli) ς thus by operis et sacti-s he means Phil.
to understand, ‘Act up to the spirit, not merely the letter, of your
promise’ (line 67); so the words pro te in lines 73 and 75 are meant
for the ear of Phil. (‘ in your place’)‚ while to Hegio they would merely
sound like a somewhat hyperbolical statement of the case (‘You will
be the free man instead os me, I shall be the slave instead ofyou,' 75).
On the other hand, the words te aestumatum (73), te hinc aestuma-
tum mittier, Nam pater saciet, etc. (80), are thrown in as explana-
tions for the benefit of Hegio]

69. operis. The plural again, Bacch. 1 1. 11 (45), Asin. 11 4. 19,
etc. So in other abstract substantives, e.g. opulentiae Trin. 11 4. 89,
qratiae ibid. 1 1. 14, parsimoniae ibid. 1v 3. 21, perfidiae Capt. 111
3. 7, irae Mil. 11 6. 100, industriae Most. 11 1. l, superbiae Stich. 11
2. 27,pace3 Pers. v 1. l.

70. quo minus, lit. ‘in proportion as Ι have said less‚' i. e. ‘in so
far as 1 have not said.' So Ter. Eun. 1v 5. 11 correxit miles, qao
intelle-‚ci minus (where quo, the reading of A, has been corrected to
quod, which also stands in the other MSS.).—[d0 te, ‘about you.¹
T ynd. desires Phil. to understand, ‘If I have not said all the good
of you that 1 could have wished (since in appearing to praise you, I
was really praising myself)‚ refiect upon the cause (animam adaertas)
and do not take offence.']

73. pignori, sometimes pz'qnerz‘, with weakening of the ο of the
stem, as in foederis, sceleris ,· cf. temporis with the adv. temperi.

74. quom extemplo (lv 2. 6, Trin. 11 1. 20) εὲπεὶ τάχιστα.
