That the prosody os Plautus differs in many respects from
that of Horace, virgil and Ovid‚ has been at all times generally
recognized 3 but it was a gross misrepresentation of the facts
of the case when the practice of the poets of the Augu-stan age
was set up as an absolute standard to which verse of all kinds
and all times ought to conform, and whatever was at variance
with it in earlier poets was explained as a “ license'' or a proof
of their barbarous versification. In Plautus, as in all early
dra-matie poetry, the laws of quantity of syllables and their
adaptation to metre rest mainly on the usage of popular speech,
and exhibit essentially the same negligences and inconsisten-
cies as the pronunciation of daily life itself. A totally different
tendency manifests itself in the later reforming school of
Ennius, with its new metre, the Dactylic Hexameter. The
rhythm of this verse, with its inflexible monosyllabic arsis and
its nicely defined double thesis (of one long or two short), was
irreconcilable with the freer prosodic movement which had
been found unobjectionable in earlier verse3 it demanded that
terminations should be strictly scanned, and every syllable of
the language rigidly classified under one of the two great cate-
gories‚ long oi· short. Thus for the Hexameter there grew up
a fixed law corresponding to the precision os Greek prosody;
while in the iambic and trochaic metres of drainatic poeti-y,
the usage not only of Ennius himself, but also of Terence,
Pacuvius and Accius, did not on the whole constitute an
advance upon the prosody of I‘lautus3 it was Catullus and
Horace who first extended the stringent rule observed in the
Hexameter to iambic measures.
