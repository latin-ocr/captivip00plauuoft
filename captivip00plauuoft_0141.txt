better acquaiuted with it from other sources 3 and he adds, that had
Camerarius been able to use it, it would have been of little use to
him by the side of the Codex Vetus.

It was Wagner, however, who first controverted the traditional
opinion of this MS. His line of argument is as follows : firstly, he
points out the frequent agreement of J with late MSS„ such as the
‘Pali Sex’ of Pareus, the Langiani, etc.; secondly, he charges J
with the fatal defect of being a “corrected copy ;'’ that is to say,
he maintains that the copyist did not confine himself to copying,
but emended the text- as he went on, according to his own judgment.
This would of course seriously impair the value of the Ms·.; for
however faulty the archetype may have been, its errors would, as
Wagner says, have been “more wele-nne to us than the emenda-
tions of an ignorant mediaeval grammarian.” In proof of his state-
ment, lVagner relies upon two arguments: (l) a number of passages
which he quotes from the Aulularia, in which he maintains that
such corrections have been made in J 3 (2) after quoting the bar-
barous verses which are appended to the MS. on the last folio,
and which run as follows,

Exemplar mendum tandem me compulit ipsum

Cunctantem nimium plautum exemplarier istum
Ne graspicus mendis proprias idiota repertis

Ad deret. et liber hic falso patre falsior esset,

he adds, that they must be admitted to “ coutain truth :” and he
seems to understand them to mean that the scribe emended the text
in order to improve an ‘ exemplar mendum' or faulty archetype. I
shall have to return to these verses; but will not discuss their
meaning here, in order to bring up the sketch of the controversy to
the present time.

WVagner’s attack was followed up by an anonymous writer in the
Philologischer Anzeiger (1872, p. 391), who maintained that even
the opinion of lVagner was too favourable to J, and that on the
ground of the “ fatal agreement‘’ of J with minor MSS„ it must be
classed together with them, and all referred to one and the same
source.

Our MS„ however, has found a defendet in G. Go'tz‚ one of the
editors who is continuing the edition of Plautus commenced by
Ritschl. His view of its value is based upon an accurate 00111ιῖ1011,δε
and is stated in his Analecta Plautina (Leipsic, 1877), his Preface
to the Epidicus (Leipsic, 1878), and an article in the Rheinischcs
Museum (1879, p. 52 seq.). His position is shortly this z that the
evidence produced by Wagner to prove that J is a corrected copy,
by no means bears out such an assertion, although a passage may
here and there be found in which the hand of a corrector can be

⁹ 1 may state that I have examined the passages in which he notes a divergence
between this collation and that of Wagner (Anal. Pl. p. 73); in all of them the
collatiou ot* Emil Braun is quite accurate.
