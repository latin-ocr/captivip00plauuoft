126 NOTEs. [v 4. 9—31

9. quid gnate 11112 ‘What do you mean by quate mi?' The
words that excite surprise are usually repeated without alteration :
Bacch. 1 2. 39 ΡΙ. Omitte, Lyde, ac caue malo. LY. Quid ‘caue
malo'? So in Mil. 11 3. 45, Rud. 111 4. 31, Cas. 11 8. 18 seq.,
11 5. 41.

11. lucis: during his brief term of punishment he has had to

break stones sub terra. The word lux is generally masc. in Plautus,

as Aul. 1v 10. 22 [cf. Wagner's note] 3 Cist. 11 1. 58 (also Ter. Adel.
841); fem. only in Amph. 1 3. 49 luce clara et candida. [The
present passage, however, might be explained differently, as
containing the same construction as nominandi istorum, IV 2. 72.
In both cases the genitive depends on the word copim]

12. Et tu=you also.

17. 11110, i.e. Stalagmus, ‘the slave,’ in order to distinguish him
from is (15), Theodoromedes—[una. The MSS. have hunc; but
this would not be Latin 3 see on Prol. 2.]

[18. intus 00011111, cf. 1 2. 60 (eccum hic) and note. In neither case
is the person alluded to on the stage]

19. ais. For the long final syll., see Intr. B.—The MSS. here,
as often, transpose the last two words in the line 3 so even the

Ambrosian MS. in one passage.

[21. ΒΓ. considers that lines 14-20 are an interpolation, made
by some person who thought greater detail was necessary, and that
the eud οῗ 14 and the beginning of 20 were altered to suit the
insertion.

25. Probably an alternative reading (suggested orig. in the
margin) for the next line.

26. In memoriam regredior, cf. Cic. Verr. 11 1. 46 redite in
memoriam iudices ,· the memory is regarded as something obJective,
or externa] to the subject.

27. Quasi per nebulam3 the same phrase Pseud. 15. 48. [Τ110
words must here be joined with in memoriam regyredz'or, which is
equivalent to ‘I reeollect.' The pause in the sense thus gives a
ground of justification for the hiatus, which also precedes a proper
name: see Intr. D (ii).—There is nothing impossible in this
recollection on the part of Tyndarus of a name not heard since the
age of four years, though the passage has been objected to as an
improbability, see in Lessing (Kritik, etc.)].

29. id praeuorti, cf. ιι 3. 100, 111 2. 14. The ace. of 'the pron. ἰαὶ
(80 hoc, illud) represents a dative of a subst. Sometimes the idea.
of prae- is strengthened by the addition ofprz'mum.

31. recte feceris, se. si quid mihi dederis. The company of
actore, or one actor in their name, speaks the Epilogue, which
bears traces of the same hand that composed the l‘rologue. [cf.
ad pudicos mores with neque spurcidici insunt uorsus inmemorabile-9
l'rol. 56]
