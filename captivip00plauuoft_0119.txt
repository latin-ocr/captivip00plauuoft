111 4. 30-42] · ’ Nonas. 107

ironically [like the English ‘very likely: ‘I dare say,’ or the French
‘Il en a l’air'J. So Poen. 1 1, 13, AGOR. anoscere id te mi aequom est.
Μμ-Ρ. Haud uidi maffl‘s! sc. aequom, ‘ Oh, of course, bare justice!'
and Amph. n 2. 57, AMPH. Expectatusne aduenio? Sos. Hand

uidi maqz‘s eapectatam, quem salutat mayis haud quisquam quam
canem,· and Merc. 1v 3. 24.

30. In order to excite Arist. to a pioeh of fury which should
resemble real madness, Tynd compares him with three celebrated
madmen. The last, Lycurgus, King of the Edoni of Thrace, was
punished with madness for his attack upon the worship of Dionysus.
[Alcmaeo‚ Ἀλκμαίων. Alcmaeon was a celebrated person on the
tragic stage, as Gepp. says, and it is hardly-likely that Plaut.
woulcll1 have rechristened him Alcumeus (so O. Ribbeck)]—postea,
‘ in t at case!

31. una opera . . . qua, ‘just as much aS‚’ cs. on 11 2. 43.

35. uero, ⁴ in realityss modal abl, not the adversative particle, so
Most. 1 3. 21, manis uz‘tuperarier βιῶ-ο, quam uero extolli? Mero.
tv l. 19, Truc. 11 2. 47. Sometimes joined with serio, Amph.
111 3. 9 (equidem serio ac uero ratas), Pseud. 1v 7. 96 (responde hoc

uero serio). So in the phrases αιή uero? itane uero ? ita hercle
uero, ete.

36. [Ironically‚ ‘It was reserved for you, I suppose, to prove
your superiority to Phil. in exactness of statement.’ Tynd. desires
at the same time to give Arist. a hint that his superior information
as to the person of Phil. is rather inopportune.]—enim is often
found in Plaut. as an affirmative or asseverative (not inative)
particle, especially in the combinations at enim, quia em'm, uon
' enim, nil enim, nunc enim, certe enim, immo enim, and euim uero
(thus Trin. 111 2. 7 9, non enim pos-sum quin exclamem), but also
in other connectione, eg. Cas. 11 4. 2, Te uxor aiebat tua me
uocare ; ST. qu enim uocari iussi ef. Trin. v 2. 10.

conuinoas, ‘ put truth in the wrong ' ].

41. Alidem without a preposition only in this place, cf. 11 3. 19,
111 4. 56. So Alide without in only in 11 2. 80. The simple acc.
and abl. (without a preposition) of names of countries seems to
have been a peculiarity of early Latin; sor Alis is not to be
regarded as the name of a town; so nequinont Graeciam redire
(Livius Andronicus), and even later Nep. Milt. 1 Chersonnesnm

mittere, Dat. Ν Aeqyptum proticisci. But at the time of Plaut. it
was becoming usual to insert the preposition.

42. According to old Roman law the slave is a chattel,
possessing neither father nor the rights of contracting a legal
marriage and holding property, in a word, without ‘caput’ or
‘status' [See Ramsay, Rom. Antiq. p. 83]
