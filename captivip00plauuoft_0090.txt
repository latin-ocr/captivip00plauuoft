7 8 NOTES. [raoL. 33—56

33. reconciliare, asin the lines of Plautus himself, 1 2. 59, 111 4. 44
= recuperare, recipcre (Ι 1. 35). So conciliare 1 2. 22 (ante-classical).

34. [Ι have followed F 1., Br. and Studemund, in tiarisposing hosce.
de pracda, and correcting the second dc (which is very clumsy and
may have been caused by the termination cla) to (ι, in accordance
with the reading of the MSS. in 11 3. 93, from which and 1 2. 2 the
present line seems to have been horrowed. In Epid. v 1. 15 the
Anibrosian MS. preserves the phrase emi clepo-aeda, where the other
MSS. have esc pracda.]———quaestoribus‚ as though the scene were laid
in Rome. The qaae-stores urbam· were entrusted with the task of
selling the war booty and prisonerS.

35. hisce, nom. pl. (for Iti-cc), sometimes boisce. This old form of
the termination is attested by inscriptions not only for the pronouns
Mc, ille, is, ici'em, qni, but also for substantives of the 2nd decl.; e.g.
we find conscriptoss5 publz'ccis, etc. [A still earlier form was ea, eg.
mccyz'stres, Atilios]

36. amittat, see on Arg. 7.
39. According to Bitschl (opusc. 11 p. 687) we are to scan 71 {c illius.

44. [imprudens, ‘unintentionally.']—saepe jam multis in locis, a
pleonastic expression, which has held its ground even in later Latin.

[4⁴6. Sed is rcsumptive, after the digressive remark itidem . . . bomss]

[48. An interpolation, probably a gloss on line 46, itaque corre-
sponding to Sed. Brix, after Lorenz, brackets 46—49.]

49. ad, even with names of persons, has sometimes the sense of
ade, where there is a collateral notion of place3 cf. 111 5. 41, Stich.
111 1. 35 jubebo ad &marinum cescum coqui.

[ἶΟὸ ]The speaker has now fulfilled his promise given in verses 5
an( .

[51. Bracketed hy Fl. as an ‘interpolatio foedissimass on the ground
both of sense and meti-e. But to strike out all the lines of doubtful
elegance in the Arguments and Prologues is to ignore their character
and origin 3 cf. note on 10 3 cum belle recoffl'to occurs Cure. 111 5.]

52. uobis fabula. ‘Nos hoc representabimus ornatu, voce, vultu
gestuque quasi rem veram, quasi essemus illi, quibus hoc evenit:
robis id erit spectaculum et ludus.’ Gronovius. Lessing proposed to
invert the order of the words nobis, uobis; but thc above sense is
more natural.

53. etiam, ‘furthcr,’ ‘in addition.’—uoluerim, potential‚ sec 11 2. 59.

55. non pertractate, ‘ not in the ordinary hackneyed manner,' [an
ἑίπ. λεγ., and a very strange expression]

56. [This is a true description of the play; see Introd.]—inmem0-
rabiles z non memorandi. Adjcctivcs in hilis usually denote ‘ what

may l›e‚' but sometimes in Plautus ‘ what must bc‚’ eg. Rud. 111 2. 40
ΕιΙψωΙ fnfhrtmzio hominvm proram-as ‹lomaeln’lcm ( z donandum).
