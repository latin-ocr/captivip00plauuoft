97. The verse is imperfect in the MSS. ; Camerarius added Iam,
and Bothe ingeniously proposed custodela for custode ,· [cf. Rud. 111
3. 35, where Lind. thinks the same change should be made]

[98. Brix and F leck. insert ad before captiuos (metri gratia) ; but,
as Ussing remarks, the verse seems to have a further corruption, as

6. ieiuniosus, as well as what follows, is an attribute of the ‘evil
