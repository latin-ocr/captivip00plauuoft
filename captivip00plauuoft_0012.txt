NOTE TO THE NEW EDITION.

IN the form in which this book now appears, Ι have added
an Excursus upon the MS. J, and the Appendix which Ι
announced as in preparation last autumn, containing Bentley's
emendations upon the other plays of Plautus. Ι have further
reprinted (p. 162) from the Classical Journal of the year 1812,
a list of Bentley's books now in the British Museum, and all
containing MS. notes by him. This list, of the existence of
which I only recently became auare, Ι have completed‚ with
the help of the Museum Catalogue: it will, Ι hope, give a
tolerably correct idea of the rich treasure of Bentleiana, which
still lies unedited in our national Museum.* Ι have also added
(p. 161) a list of the readings which Ι have been able to restore
in J from Bentley's collation of the MS. (See Pref. p. vi, note).

To my text Ι have added the numbers of the lines in
Fleckeisen's edition. My Critical Apparatus is now rendered
more complete and consistent by the addition of the readings
of D in a number of passages communicated to me since last
autumn by Prof. Studemund (marked S), and by a second
collation of J, made by Dr. L. A. P. Schroeder. Ι arn further
indebted to E. M. Thompson, Esq., Keeper of MSS. in the
Museutn, for several hints with regard to my Excursus3 and
to the great kindness of my friend, A. W. K. Miller, Esq„ MA„
Fellow of University College‚ London, who gave me valuable
assistance during a period of very hard work in the Museum.

I would call the attention of the reader to the note on
page 2 (Introduction).
