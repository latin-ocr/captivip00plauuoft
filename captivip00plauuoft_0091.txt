rnon. 57—1 1. 1] NOTES. · 79

Sometimes, again, they have an active signification, eg. αιζφάίαῖιίἶίε
(Eng. serviceable) Mil. 1v 4. 8, uoluptabilis (plcasing) Epid. 1 1. 19,
impetrabili-s (successful) Most. v 2. 40. To these add the penetrabile
frique (piercing cold) of virgil, and Cic. de Nat. Deor. 11 36. 91
natm-a animabitis (quickening), ibid. 39. 98 varietas insatiabilis
(which never produces satiety, never cloys).

57. Periurus leno, etc, some of the stock characters of comedy.

[58. ne uereamini, in the spirit of Bottom (Midsummer Night's
Drcam, Act 111 Sc. 1) : ‘⁶ F air ladies‚ I would entreat you not to fear
. . . if you think Ι come hither as a lion, it were pity of my life‚” ete]

60. foris illic. For the short syll. foris see Introd. A (ii).-—[N0-
thing would have plcased the audience better than a little fighting
on the stage3 the speaker of the Prol. here comically disappoints
any cxpectation that his words Ne zcerewnz'm', etc„ might have raised]

61. iniquomst, ‘ would be au unfair demand.’ [For the indicative,
cf. lonqum est ecc dicere,· set] leoc breue dicam (Cic. Sest. 5.) ‘it would
be tedious.⁷]—chorag·ium, here ‘stage properties’ (instrumentum sce·
narum). The chorusque· of the Romans was an essentially different
person from the χορηγός of the Atheniens, and seems to have been
merely a ‘ costumier‚' whose business was not even confined to the

,theatre (cf. Pers. 1 3. 79). Similarly ckorccqium has nothing of the
meaning of χορὴγιον, but denotes ‘ wardrobe’ in general. It is there-
fore the addition of comicum which gives the special reference to the
theatre. [Similarly the verb χορηγέω becomes quite general, e. g. in
Arist. Eth. Nic. 10. 15 τοῖς ἐκτὸς ἀγαθοῖς ἱκανῶς κεχορηγημένον]

62. tragoediam. Battles were not represented on the stage either
in the Greek tragedies or in the Roman fabulae crepidatae imitated
from them ; but that they were sometimes introduced into the prae-
textae or tragedies on native Roman subjects is attested by Hor. Ep.
11. 1. 189 seq. and Cic. ad Fam. vn 1. 2. [As the praeteria is to the
crepidam, so is the tussam (Latin comedy of Roman life) to the 1]ch-
Ziata (Latin comedy representing Greek life and manners).]—nos.
The speaker of the Prol. is therefore one of the actors 3 cf. Prol.
Poen. 125 alius nuncfierz' uolo.

[65. faciam ut, ‘ Ι will take care, warrant.']

68. duellum, old form of bellum, always pronounced with synizesis
as two syllables—duelli duellatores balances domi indices· [‘ as you are
gallant soldiers in war ;' for que cf. Hor. Ep. 1 6. 31 Virtutem uerba
putas et lucum ligna]

 

Ι. 1.

1. The Menaechmi opens by a similar remark of the parasite
Peniculus, who explains the origin of his name. Parasites were
usually dressed in black or grey clothes, with the addition of all
sorts of devices to excite ridicule (see Lorenz, Introd. to Most. p. 16).
