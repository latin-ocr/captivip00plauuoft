have therefore been content to give the passage as it stands iu B
and J. where the MSS. fail us as they do here, the problem of

[15. inde abii seems to be an interpolation ,- Br. transfers the
words to 19 (after exsoluz'.)]

17. hio, i.e. Aristophontes.

 

ΙΙΙ. 3.

1. nnnc illud est, quom, ‘now the point of time has arrived, at

sua consilia conserant . . . . auxili nil adferant—fuisse, cf. note on

11 1. 50.

2. spernunt=secer7mnt or sez'zmqunt (old Latin). For this rare
sense, cf. Ennius in Non. p. 399 ias atque aecum se α mali->- spernit

procul.
4. neque adeo, cf. on 11 2. 98.—metum‚ ‘danger‚’ the subjective

for the objective idea, cf. Trin. 1v 3. 2.

[5. A versified gloss on the next line]

6. [fucis for trickery, cf. Cic. ad Att. 1 1 sine fuco et fallaciis]—
ob uiamst :inpromptu est, ade-st.

7. perfidiis. For the plural, cf. on 11 3. 69.

8. hospitium3 cf. Most. 11 1. 3 nusquam stabulmnst cmvfidentzkce.

10. negotiumst. With the humour of despair he says, ‘there
will be no difficulty,’ instead of non dubium est‚· hence quin in next

line. [The line is unmetrical]

11. malam pestem oppetere (cf. mortem opp), again Asin. 1 1. 7.

13. Philocrati may be either dative or genitive, as v 2. 22, and

[17. Incipisso and haereo form a. hiatus ; ef. note on 111 1. 21, and
Introd. D. ii. The line is a senarius, and corresponds to 15. Ritschl
has turned both 15 and 17 into septenarii, by adding Me expediemdz·

to the former, and writing the latter h
aereo

Nisn· nugas ineptiasque iam incipisso maxumas.

But Tynd. has already said Nisi si aliquam machinor astutiam, and
in the next soene he says nisi reperio aliquam astutiam (7). Tho
*introduction of the same thing a third time would be monotonous]
