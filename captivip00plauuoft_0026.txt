with colliding vowels nearly always suffer synizesis, as: proin,
proinde, dehine, dein, deinde, praeamara* deerrare, dehortor Capt.
Π 1. 16, deartuatus ibid. 111 5. 14, deosculari, &c.; intro ire is
not a case in point, because intro and ire (so intro and mittere,
rumpere, ducere, ferre) always form two separate words. In
the forms aibam, audibam, scibam, dicim, ditior, the synizesis
has even stamped itself upon the spelling 3 likewise in quattor
(for quattuor, see Ritschl Rhein. Mus. VIII p. 309), mensum,
amantum, clzcentum, so that we are not surprised at omnium
occurring as a dissyllable‚ Trin. IV 2. 88, V 1. 1. 011 the other
hand, vowel contractions like gratias, otio, filio, yaudiis, are
found only in the more unwieldy metres, which are exempt
from many of the ordinary rules, that is to say, the Troch.Tet1·.
Acat. and the Anapaestic measures3 while in the commoner
and lighter ones they are not permitted Thus, for instance,
the word yrcttis, which is always found in its contracted form
in later times, never appears in Plautus or Terence except
with its full ablative termination as qratiis (and so inqratiis).
D. Hiatus. Not the least difficult among the many difficult questions
that arise in connection with the verse of Plautus is the deter-
mination of the extent to which, and conditione under which,
he permitted himself the use of Hiatus, and a few words must
be said about it here. In general, 110 doubt, the Romans re-
garded the hiatus as anything but a beauty. They were so
much in the habit of eliding their vowels, that Cicero says
(Orat. ξ 150) ε Nemo tam rusticus est, qui vocales nolit conjunyere.
Hence 111 Plautus we should expect to find hiatus chiefly in
those cases where a break in the metre or in the sense occa-
(i) Metrical sioned or permitted a pause in the speaker's utterance. As
pauses. mctrvz‘cal pauses allowing of hiatus may be reckoned the Caesura
in the Cretic Tetr. (Trin. 11 1. 37 Fleck.)‚ in the Bacch. Tetr.
(Capt. 111 2. 8), in the Troch. Tetr. Cat. or Acat. (Capt. 11 2. 81,
IV 2. 66, 81, v 2. 24), 111 the Anapaest. Tetr. (Mil. IV 2. 23, 65),
and the Iamb. Tetr. Cat. (Septenarius). In some of these exam·
ples the metrical pause coincides with a pause in the sense ; yet,
on the other hand, an overwhelming majority of verses written
