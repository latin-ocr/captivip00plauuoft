1 6 INTRODUC‘TION.

hiatus between two vowels of the same character as canoras*
atque iucundus, adding, est adeo inuenire apud nobiles poetas
lmimcemodi suauitatis multa, quae appareat nauata esse ‘non
fortuita. And Quintilian bears testimony to the same fact
(Inst. Orat. IX 4. 36), “Nam etsi coeuntes litterae, quae συναλοιφαὶ
dicuntur, etiam leniorem reddunt omtimzem, quam si omnia
‘cerba suo fine clauduntur, et non nunquam hiulca etiam decent
faciuntque ampliora quaedam, ut: ‘pulchra oratione aeta om-
nino iactare ;''' if we compare this passage with the passage
of Cicero above quoted, it wffl appear that the latter only lays
emphasis on one side of the truth.

SOURCES OF THE TEXT.

The MSS. os importance which contain the Captivi are :

(1) The Codex Vetus (B), a MS. of the llth century, now
in the Vatican Library at Rome. It was originally discovered
in the middle of the sixteenth century by the great German
scholar J oachim Camerarius, and is the main authority on
which the text of Plautus rests. It contains all the twenty
comedies. The original reading of B has been in many places
corrected by several hands of various ages, the most important
being the so-called “ manus seczmda.²’

(2) The Codex Britannicus (J), a MS. also of the end of
the llth or beginning of the l2th century, probably of English
origin, and now in the British Museum. It contains only eight
plays, the Amphitruo, Asinaria, Aulularia, Captivi, Curculio,
Casina, Cistellaria, and Epidicus. It has severely suffered by
fire, the beginnings or ends of lines being often quite illegible.

(3) The Codex Ursinianus, or Vaticanus (D), a MS. of the
12th century, now in the Vatican, and containing, besides the
last twelve plays, the Amphitruo, Asinaria, Aulularia, and
about one half of the Captivi (to 111 2. 4). This MS. was the
chief authority for the text of the plays which it contains,
until the discovery of thc Codex Vetus by Camerarius.
