136 APPENDIX.

pcndently. But whether new or not, all Bentley's corrections have a
value 3 it is worth while to know which of the emendations of pre-
vious editors he approved 3 and some of the suggestions of more
modern scholars receive a new and important confirmation from the
fact that they were long ago made by the founder of conjectural criti-
cism. The general reader, too, may acquire fresh confidence in the
methods of eonjectural emendation of ancient texts from so convinc-
ing a proof that in a large number of cases they lead independent
critics to identical results 3 and possibly even the general impression
current in England‚ that Bentley was in the habit of dealing some-
what recklessly with MS. authority, may receive some modification
when it is found that his criticism anticipates, as it were at a blow,
much of the results of modern investigation.

In extracting Bentley’s emendations, Ι have proceeded on the plan
of interpreting his signs and giving the result 3 thus, where Bentley
writes 1 2 111 the margin, and indicates by a curved line the words
to be transposed, I have written the words in the new order 3 where
Bentley writes del. in the margin, and puts dots under the letters to
be deleted, I have given the word as he meant to read it. In all
cases the word or words of Parcus which he eorrects are given on
the left of a square bracket, his correction appearing on the right.
But I have so far as possible avoided making any change, even of
the minutest character, which Bentley's signs do not warrant, even
though it is perfeetly clear that Bentley himself would have made
some further alteration had he written the word or sentence out in
full, instead of merely indicating the correction to be made. Thus
where Pareus prints a substantive with a capital, apparently follow-
ing the usage of German, and Bentley, in making some other cor-
rection in the word, does not take the trouble to correct the capital,
I have allowed it to stand 011 the right of the bracket also. In
certain cases, indeed, it has been impossible to carry this out with
absolute consistency3 where Pareus for instance gives ajebat, and
Bentley deletes the e, I have of course written cahat, not ajbat ,· so
where he corrects elavi by deleting the α, Ι have given elul, not clvi.
Again, when a capital in Parcus indicates the beginning of a new
sentence or line, and Bentley changes the order of the words without
expressly alter-ing the capital, it seemed best sor the sake of clear·
ness to made the slight further change 3 thus Egyo te would, if trans-
posed, appear as Te eqo. there Bentley removes a whole word
from the text, my plan has been to write the word, together with
that immediately preceding or following it, on the lest of the bracket,
and to repeat the latter alone on the right. Thus in Epid. 1 2. 23,
