116 NOTES. [tv 2. 28-— 43

ad Persicum usque bellum annis ab urbe cond. super DLXXX.
Ipsi panem faciebant Quirites mulierumque id opus erat.’'
fuss-auibus. The singular furfur denotes a ‘ husk, scale,’ the plural
‘ bran‚' as has been shown by A. Luchs (in Studem. Stud. 1. p. 56)
from passages in Varro, Columella, Pliny, and Phaedrus. In line
30 the MSS. preserve the plural furfures.

28. odore = propter odorem.

30. Dominis, substituted‚ παρὰ προσδοκίαν, for scrofis—[exculcabo
pugnis, a mixed metaphor.]

34. qui (sc. piscatores) aduehuntur, ‘ ride to market.’—crucia.nti‚
i.e. jolting.

35. quorum odos, i.e. that caused by their rotten fish. [sub-
basilicarii, ‘those under the porticoes of the basilica! We are
expressly told by Livy, XXVI 27. 3, that in the year of the fire
which destroyed a great part of the Forum (210 B.C.)‚ there were
no basilicae at Rome ; and the first mention that we have of the
building of one is in the censorship of M. Porcius Cato, B. C. 184, the
year of Plautus’ death (see Livy, mlx 44. 7). Hence Brix infers
that the present passage (and Curc. 1v 1. 11) which make mention
of a basilica, must be of later date and not by Plaut. himself ; and
the ‘Dict. of Antiq.‚' p. 198, asserts that the Basilica Porcia was
the first erected at Rome. But, as Ussing remarks, this is nowhere
stated by Livy3 and it is quite possible that during the twenty-
six years (BC. 210-184) some other basihca may have sprung up.]

36. ‘I will throw their fish baskets in their faces.'
38. concinnant (cf. 111 4. 69), see on 39.

39. locant. W'e must suppose that the lanii were not butchers,
but rather dealers in cattle and meat 3 in some cases they may
have contracted to have their own cattle killed in slaughter-
houses for them. Hence concinnant (38) ‘who lto-inq about the
destruction of young lambs,' not slaughter them with their own
hands. Hence, too, dupla, ‘who seu lamb at double its proper
price.' [The MSS. read duplum, which might possibly mean ‘lamb
twice as old as it should be,' i.e. mutton. Ussing suggests dubiam,
i.e. dc qua dubitetur, utrum aqui au ovis sit, as in Ter. Phorm. 11 2.
28, cena dubia.]—Agnina (sc. caro) cf. „porcina (69) and bubula,
uitulina.

40. petro, ‘ old wether ;'—-ueruex sectarius, ‘ gelded sheep ' [secoJ.
[41. Eorum Br. 3 on the model of 29]

42. mortalis. He humorously classes the lanius and the sheep
together as mortales.

43. To the aediles belonged the charge of superintending the
traffic in the markets. [The sevcnth foot is a dactyl, which is
strictly inadmissible in this place, cf. Christ Metrik, p. 296 and
cf. p. 279. Br. accordingly considers the line an interpolation]
