[52. The origin of the mistak e uel assultaiz'm in BJ,'1s clearly
shown by one of the minor MSS. (Leid. A), which has assultatim
uel asmiatim ; the gloss was only partially removed from the text
by the correfftor 3 see Lind. The line is quoted by Nonius (p. 72)
without uel.

is certainly strange, both on account of the hiatus and because it
occurs conjoined with the names of various kinds of fislz, although
the speaker goes on to caseus in the next line, and was speaking
