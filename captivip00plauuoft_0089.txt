sent after postquam and quom is a common convcrsational idiom3

not elidcd. See on the whole subject of non-elision of syllables
ending in m, Corssen 11 790, and comp. Cure. 1v 2. 37 ete. It is
probable that in the Latin of the time of Plautus, m had only par-

27. Hic, i.e. Heyz'o. [ {ut this is harsh, and Geppert supposes that
some lines have fallen out after Alide. We should certainly have
⁷ expected to be told that Menarchus was a client of Theodoromedes,
which is an important fact in the development of the story (see 11 2.
85 seq. ). —commercarL 'lhe prefix si gnifies‘ theron( ghly‚' as in ‘the

The whole line is modelled upon 1 1. 32.

[Virg. A. 11 136, 756.]—qui mutet suom, Eng. ‘whom he might ex-
ehange for his own son.'—qui (an old abl. :quo, see 1 1. 33, Trin.
Prol. 14) is an emendation of ΕΙ. [For the abl. with mutare, cf. Hor.
Od. 1 17. 1 Veloae amoenum saepe Lucretilem Μ atat Lycaeo Faunus.
In these cases mutare means ‘to take in exchange‚' and the abl. is
analogous to an abl. of price. On the other hand, we find in Od. 1
16. 26 mutare tr istia mitibus, where it means “rive in exehan re for. ']

[29. Again the speaker uses every effort to m 1ke his meaninw
clear, ando to avoid any confusion of the son captured in war with
the son who ls a slave to his own father. ]

[30. indaudiuit, a certain correction. The old form of the prepo-
sition in is seen in such words as z'mZ-z'piscm·, ital-uo, ind-aliae, [mli-
(sena, incl-olm, imeae-perator. Inclamlt're means ‘to catch the first
sound‚’ 015 the analogy of ι’ῃιῖιιιο ‘ to give asia-st wetting‚' informat-e
‘to give the first shape.' Hence the idea of impmy‘eclae'un in these
verbs, eg. lae'tterz's Graccis imbutas τ- with a smattering of Greek
learning]

[31. For the hiatus in the caesura minor, compare Men. 111 3. 3,
111 2. 30, Poen. 1 3. 34, etc. With this proper name there occurs
hiatus above, line 24 and in 1 2. 60.]
