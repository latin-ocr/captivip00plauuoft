readings. Ι have been able, however, to make a valuable addi-
tion to my Critioal Apparatus, in a considerable number of
emendations by Richard Bentley, which are here published for
the first time. These I found in the British Museum, written
in the margin of a copy of Pareus (Press Mark, 682. b. 10). A
comparison of these notes with other specimens of Bentley’s
handwriting leaves no doubt whatever that they are really
Bentley's own. But the best proof of their genuineness is
furnished by the readings themselves, which could only have
proceeded from a scholar of Bentley’s calibre. In one passage
(ΙΙΙ 5. 66, 67) t-he marginal correction is identical with one
proposed 'm Bentley’s edition of Terence* These readings Ι
have further, in the majority of cases, introduced into my text ;
which, nevertheless‚ will be found to be on the whole con-
siderably nearer the MSS. even than that of Dr. Brix. In this
part of my work Ι have derived great assistance from the Criti-
cal Appendix of Dr. Brix and the notes of Ussing (Vol. IL,
Havniae, 1878); besides these, I have used the editions of
Lindemann (Leipzic, 1830), VVeise (Quedlinburg‚ 1847-48),
Fleckeisen (Vol. 1„ stereotyped ed„ Leipzic, first published in
1850), and Geppert (Berlin, 1859), the “ Plautinische Pro-
sodie'' of Miiller (Berlin, 1869), the “Metrik der Griechen
und Romer'' of Christ (Leipsic, 1879), and the work of A.
Spengel on Plautus (“Kritik, Prosodie, Metrik,’' G6ttingen,
1865). My special thanks are due to Professor W. Studemund,
of Strassburg, who most kindly sent me informat-,ion as to the
readings of the Vatican MSS. (B and D) in some cases in which
a doubt or difficulty arose.

With regard to the explanatory notes at the end of the book,

ἵ· Many of these emendations have since been independently made by
other scholars, among whom I may mention Lindemann, Fleckeisen, and
Dr. Brix. But among some fifty-three corrections in the Captivi, less
than one third, and these sor the most part the more obvious ones,
are adoptrd from previous editors. Besides the readings approved by
himself, which he distinguis-hes by the word “ leg.,'' Bentley has added
in tln· sanie copy os Parcus a collation os the most important variants of
the levx Britannicus, to which he had necess as keeper of the Royal
Libram· at St. Jannes'. These have some valae, not only as showing the
res-pert that antlvy had sor this MS„ but because tho)v were copied before
