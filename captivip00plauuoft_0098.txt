86 NOTES. [1 2. 71—85

‘ Going, going, gone 1‘ (i. e. I accept your invitation, unless some one
makes me a better offer). In answer to Erg.’s protest against a too
stingy entertainment, Hegio humorously proposes to settle the matter
by a formal contract (stipulatio), Erg. making his demand as to each
item of the feast (rogare), and Hegio declaring his consent or refusal
(promittere). There is a good instance of such a contract in full
(here merely hinted at in the word mssa) in Bacch. Ν 7. 40 seq. The
parasite, replying to this jest with another, represents invitation and
acceptance of invitation as a bargain for sale, in which Hegio appears
as purchaser, Erg. as vendor, the article to be sold to the highest
bidder being the company of Erg. at dinner—[Emptum (tib-1? est) is
the formula employed in concluding a bargain; cf. Epid. 111 4. 39
Estne empta mi llaec? PE. H z's Zeyz'bzcs habeas licet]

71. condicio came to be used technically, as Uss. sayS, for an in-
vitation or engagement ; cf. Mart. XI 52. l ε

Cenabis belle, Iuli Cerealis apud me ;

74. em, ‘look you.’ This form of the demonstrative particle en
(acc. of the pronoun is) is strongly supported by the MSS. in many
passages of Plautus and Terence, and sometimes demanded by the
metre. The interjection hem, which is frequently confounded with
it in the later, and occasionally even in the earlier MSS„ is an
entirely different word, an expression of strong emotion (joy, sorrow
or surprise).

75. Heg. compares his own humble dinner to a weasel, a more
sumptuous one to a hare.

76. My fare is like a rough, stony road, and a dinner with me a
tough picce of work to get through.
