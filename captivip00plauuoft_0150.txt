138 APPEXDIX.

of it, which is then underlined also. The precise meaning of this
sign is not quite clear 3 for long I took it to denote approval of the
line or word as it stands in the text of Pareus, and this interpreta-
tion seems to be borne out by Epid. 1v 2. 33, where he puts his tick
to the word equidem in the text, adding in the margin a second tick
and the letters MS: this should mean that equidem is the reading
of J, and so in fact it is. In order, however, to avoid the danger
of reading my own inferences into Bentley’s corrections, I have
simply represented the tick by a † on the right of the bracket. If it
applies to a part only of the line, Ι have added that part on the left.

The numbers of the lines in this Appendix are those of Pareus ;
wherever the Vulgate (Gronovius, 1669, 1684) has a different
number, Ι have added it in square brackets. In order to facilitate
reference to modern editions, I have also given, throughout, the
numbering of Ritschl in the plays which he edited, and of Goetz,
Fleckeisen, Geppert or Wagner, in the rest. It is no doubt best to
study Bentley’s emendations in connection with the text of Parens 3
but if this book cannot be obtained, the text of the Vulgate is
generally sufficiently near to it to make Bentley's corrections intel-
ligible. Pareus, 011 the whole, follows the Codex Vetus (B) very
closely.

Another part of the Appendix contains the words which I
have restored to J from Bentley's collation of the MS. ; see note to
Pref. p. vi (x). On the whole, the result to be arrived at in this way
is somewhat disappointing, except in the Amphitruo, This is no
doubt partly due to the fact that Bentley's collation was never
intended to be complete; at the same time Ι think Ι have notit-ed
that precisely where the MS. is now destroyed, Bentley’s collation
becomes ineagrc or ceases 3 and Ι ani inclined to conjecture that the
Ms. had suffered sorno other injnry before Bentley collated it, and
was partly illegible in his time. Another and inore serious objection
may be made to any results arrived at in this way—that Bentley is
not entirely accurate. I have notieed the following passages in
which his collation is inisleading or wrong: in Amph. Prol. 95, J
has neme, not, as Bentley says, wmc cos,- in Aul. 111 5. ll illec, not

not (nactum,- in Epid. 1 l. 6ss ipsiius, not. ipsus. Again, in Aul. ιν 4.
23, where Parcus reads bertram, Bentley says that J has Dexter-am,-
but a point is added under the e, denoting that the letter is to be
expunctod, so that llentley‘s note is nnnccessary; in 1v 9. 18, where
Bentley says that J has sudans-<t res, prela? rus· is agitne, but no est—
