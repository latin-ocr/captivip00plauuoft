94 Noms. [11 2. 85—95

[85. Pol hic quidem hujus est cluens. If spoken by Tynd. (MSS.) this
must be an ‘aside,’ huius referring to Philocrates, who is standing
near (see 43 Sequere huc me iyitur). 111 this case the next line must
be explained as meaning that it would be easier to negotiate with a
private person than with the state. No doubt it would be more
natural to speak of Menarchus as the client of the father of Philo-
crates 3 but Theodoromedes has not been alluded to since 68, and
therefore huius can hardly refer to him 3 we must suppose that the
erilis filius here represents his father. Lind. and Brix give the
words to Phil, and make huius refer to Tynd„ considering the
exclamation, and the comparison of the next line as more in the style
of the character which Phil. is assuming, and I have followed them,
though if the words Pol—cluens are an ‘aside‚' they, at any rate,
are an ejaculation of Tynd. ‘ 111 propria persona,’ called forth by the
piece of news which he hears for the first time. Ussing retains the
words for Tynd., but explains huius as ⁴ meu->3⁷ δεικτικῶς, as in Cure.
11 1. 33, etc. But this is very forced]

86. Hoc i.e. the return of your son—[esse in procliui expresses the
idea of a facilis descensus, and the opposite of the Eng. ‘ nphill work.’]

87. Pac, ‘see to it.’—[sed te id oro. At this point Tynd. leads
Heg.·asic]le, in order to maintain an air of secrecy in making his pro-
posrtion.

88. ab re, see note on 46.
89. ille, Philopolemus.

90. hunc, Philocrates, disguised as Tyndarus—aestumatum, i. e. a
certain sum of money having been agreed upon as his price, to be
forfeited to Hegio should he fail to return (meo periculo 99, tua fide
101). The aestumatio follows 103 seq. in the ordinary form of con-
tract (stipulatio, see on 1 2. 70). [Brix strikes out te and keeps ut

(uerum quaeso, ut aestumatum), comparing v 1. 29 3 with te quaeso . . .
(les, cf. 11 3. 72]

91. misero, sce note on 1 2. 85.
93. iusseris, sc. perferri. On the quantity of uelis see Intr. A (ii).

94. nihil est, with an infin. following, ‘ It is no good 3' cf. Cas. 11

. ο.

95. transactum reddet marks a completed state, transisset an action.
Such periphrases formed of a transitive verb like fucere, reddere, tra-
dere, etc. combined with a perf. part. pass. are very frequent in the
comic poets, (1) with facere, e.g. missum aliquem Amph. v 3. 2 ; (2)
with reddere, ag. lenitum Bacch. v 2. 31, perfectum aliquid Asin. 1
1. 109 ; (3) with trudere, e.g. hot· eqr'eclum le'lu' tradam Cure. 111 15 ;
(4) with (Iure, e.g. furlum et curatum- daho Cas. 11 8. 35 (5) with
curare, eg. funestum mu· curabo Tcr. Andr. 1v 2. l.
