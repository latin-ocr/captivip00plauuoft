APPENDIX. 137

where Bentley deletes sumn, I have indicated the correction by
writing Erum suum] Erum ,· in Trin. 1 2. 14, where Bentley deletes
bene, I write bene valere] valere. In choosing between the word
that precedes the one to be omitted and that which follows it, I
have preferred the mode of indication which seemed to give the
most information, and to make the correction, so far as possible,
explain itself. Much insight may be gained from a mere study of
lists drawn up in this manner, into Bentley's methods of conjectural
emendation. Thus in the latter passage it would also have been
possible to give tibi bene] tibi, but this would have done little, apart
from the text, to teach one how such emendations are made. Simi-
larly with additions made by Bentley to the text. Here the word
after or before which the insertion is to be made appears on the left
of the bracket, and on the right the same repeated, with Bentley’s
addition, sometimes it seemed worth while to give the two words
between which the new word was to be inserted; thus in Rud. 11
3. 6, ‘is est] is ipse est. Occasionally Ι have added a remark or
explanation of my own, which then always appears between another
pair of square brackets.

The signs which Bentley employs are the following. In deleting
he either writes d (i. e. del.) in the margin, and puts dots under the
letters to be removed, or sometimes simply strikes them out in the
text, with or without the addition of d in the margin. The latter
less elaborate method he usually follows in words in Roman type
(which are eonjectural additions adopted by Pareus, the rest of his
text being in italics); sometimes he employs it to remove italice.
In making additions he employs the caret, and writes the word to
be inserted in the margin 3 in transposing words he uses figures,
sometimes in the margin with a curved line in the text (thus

 

transmitteres ί Bracchinm] 12), sometimes in the text itself. ln

 

 

correcting a word or part of a word, he underlines the part to be
corrected, and writes the correction in the margin 3 thus Epid. 1 2. 27
manduit-z] avi-sti, 11 2. 116 Jubeas] lubens.

To indicate the end of a verse, he employs an upright line, which
he introduces into the text. This 1 have simply reproduced, as the
simplest way of representing the correction, adding the word aster
which it stands on the left of a bracket: thus Cas. 111 5. 48 Par-
dalisca] Ι , οι·, Epid. 1v 2. 26 ratus] leq. Ι . Occasionally we find
a word underlined, apparently for correction, but without any emen-
dation being suggested. Finally, Bentley employs a sort of tick in
the margin, sometimes applying to a whole line, sometimes to a part
