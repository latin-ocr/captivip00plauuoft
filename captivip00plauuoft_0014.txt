2 INTROD UOTION.

Scene 2. Enter Hegio, in conversation with the Lorarius or
overseer of slaves; Hegio, evidently a man of kindly feeling,
orders him to put lighter fetters upon the two Captives3 and
after a few passages of raillery between them, the overseer
departs in order to carry out this order. Hegio then turns to
Ergasilus, who with tears describes how, in his grief on behalf
of Hegio and Philopolemus, he is being reduced to bare skin
and bones. Hegio is not altogether imposed upon, and rallies
him upon his lack of spirit, telling him of his own plans for
the recovery of his son. The interview ends with the invi-
tation to dinner for which the Parasite had been angling;
although Hegio will not promise anything more than very
hemely fare, Ergasilus accepts conditionally on his obtaining
no better offer, and both leave the stage.

Scene 3 (11 1), a Canticum* Enter the Lorarius, together
with the two Captives and a gang of domestic slaves, who
hang about the stage, actuated by interest in the new arrivals.
The exchange of dresses has already been effected, and Tyn-
darus is therefore regarded as the master. The request of the
Captives that they may be allowed to converse alone for a
moment, is readily granted by the Lorarius. Philocrates im-
plores Tyndarus to be careful and remember his part; and

play into three, instead of five, Acts. The ordinary division of the plays
of Plautus into five Acts is due to the grammarians and Italian editors at
the time of the Renaissance, the only division recognized in the MSS.
being into a number of Scenes. Conveniencc and clearness however de-
mand that some further grouping of the action be made3 and the most
rational division seems to be that into three Acts, containing the state-
ment, thc complication, and the solution of the problem respectively
(see Lei-enm, Intr. to Most. p. 16). There is a special reason for a new
arrangement 111 the case of the Captivi, as the old editors have evidently
blundercd at the end of the fourth Act. At the same time it seemed
desirable to retain the tradition-‘ll division sor purposes of reference, and
I have accordingly marked it throughout the play at the head of each
page. All the references in the Notos and Introduction are made 1ο
these numbers.

’κ A ‘Canticum’ was properly a menolog-tue, sung or rerited to the
