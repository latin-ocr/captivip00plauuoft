96 roms. [11‘ 2. loo-23. 20

110. Ad patrem nuntiari. In this phrase <again 11 3. 24) the thought
is rather of an address to which a message is to be taken, in pam· n.
(11 3. 40) that of a person.

 

II. 3.

This is not really the commencement of a new scene 5 for, as Les-
sing says, none of the characters have left the stage. Hegio now
steps on one side to inform the Pseudotyndarus of the arrangement
that has been made between himself and the Pseudophilocrates 3
after line 12, all three take part in the conversation.

1. Quae res, referring to the principal clause that follows (uolt te
ern-s).

[4. With hiatus in caesura.. For the order te aestumatum cf. 19.]
5. uelle for uelle se, cf. on 1 2. 85.

[7. nostris filiis. Probably abl. of instr. It might, however, be
dat. commodi]

8. rectum. Part. of 7·e907·‚ ‘guided‚ turned.' So Bacch. 111 3. 8
esso illum haberem rectum acl inyem'um bonnm.

[12. quom fers, ‘by bearing.’ So the German ‘indem du tragst,'
cf. note on 11 2. 106. The line has hiatus in the caesura]

[13. Gratiam and habeo form an hiatus, which Ussing considers as
partly justified by the fact that the vowel is the same in the two
words 3 he compares T er szmt conati imponere Pelio Ossam Virg.
Georg. 1 281, and capiti inhumato Hor. Od. 1 28. 24]

16. qui me quid agitem perferat, i. e. qni quid 690 aqitem perferat.
Here the subject of czffl'tem is taken ont of the object clause, and
brought prominently forward by a kind of prolepsis, as the object of
the verb of the principal clause (perferat), as commonly in Greek.
So often after scio (Trin. 11 2. 96 δοίη ta illum qno qenere ynatus sit?
Men. 11 1. 21 Εῃο illum scio quam carus sit cordi meo) ; [and also
after such other verbs as admit of being directly connected with the
subject of the dependent clause, e. g. flocci facio (Trin. 1v 2. 150),
quaero (ib. IV 2. 31), facio (Pers 111 l. 54 necessitate me, mala m‘fiam,
facis). Oui· instance above is a somewhat extreme one, as perferat
cannot strictly speaking be connected with ma. But the rationale
of a usage must be songht in the simplest and easiest examples of it;
as such, none could serve better than Capt. 111 4. 25, where the pecu-
liarity is hardly noticeablc]

17. ordine, ‘in dne succession‚‘ i. e. ‘ point by point,‘ ‘in detail ;’
so Livy XXXIX 14 omnibus ordine expositis (καθ’ ἓν &norom—[omnem

rem, an apposition to the clause qnid . . . . (system, which it sums up,
thus being the final shape which the object to perferat takes]

20. rebitas, from the old verb bitere or herere = ire ( M erc. 11 3. 127,
Pseud. ι 3. 31, Cure. 1 2. 51, Stich. 1v 2. 28), which appears in the
