134 EXCURSUS.

has been sometimes underrated : critics have never felt it to be in-
dispensable, because the minor MSS. were known first. Had J been
collated by Camerarius or Parcus, it would long ago have taken the
place which its age claims, as one of the chief authorities next to the
Codex Vetus, and therefore, in the parts of plays omitted in D, of
the greatest importance to the critic in controlling Β.

between J and the later MSS. On the contrary, there are many
passages in which J agrecs with B against them 3 thus in 111 4. 62,
BJ have fit opus, and the true reading (fune opus) must be sought
in the minor MSS. 3 in 111 4. 50, BJ have inuenire, the minor MSS.

instances might easily be multiplied‚ and the result that we arrive
at from them is, that J cannot be traced to the same immediate
source as the minor MSS, but on the contrary forms a sort of link
between B and them, belonging as it does to the same family from
which they sprang, but often preserving traces of the readings of B.
