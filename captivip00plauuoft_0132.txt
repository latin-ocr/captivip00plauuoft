120 · NOTES. [ιν ⁶2. 107—-3, 7

‹lim-283} He interrupts himself suddenly—abit, cf. on Prol. 22,
an 11 . .

108. Boia is a pun, meaning both a Boian woman, and a kind
of collar worn by slaves. Erg. says Stal. must be a Boian, because
he is wedded to a “ Boia.'' The Boii were a powerful and warlike
people of Upper Italy, who had on several occasions caused the·
Romans much annoyance, especially in the Second Punic War;
their complete subjection by Scipio Nasica and incorporation in the
province of Gallia Cisalpina (13.6. 191) was an event still fresh in
the memory of the audience.

116. Nam, see note on 111 4. 7 2.——mantiscinatus, a humorous
word formed from μάντις 011 1116 analogy of uaticz'nams. [No doubt
mantiscz‘nor is a very barbarous formation3 but perhaps it would
have been less intelligible to a Roman audience, if formed on more
seientific principles Some commentators read mantia-inatus, but
have to add a word like eqo or tu in order to scan the line.
Erg. likens himself to a προφήτης Διός (cf. Pindar N. I. 91), 0116
who with full knowledge reveals to the uninspired what is hidden
from them. An oracle did not necessarily relate to the future3
and the modern idea of ‘foretelling' does not quite correspond]
—peotito, cf. puym‘s pectere Men. v 7. 30, and 1116 similar metaphor,
fuste dolare, Hor. Sat. 1 5. 22.

118. In order to secure his position, Erg. binds his host by a
formal contract (stipulatio). [The question might be put by the
stipulator either as above or by any one of the following words,
Dabis ?‚ Promittis ?, Fide promittis ?‚ Fide iubes 2, Facies ?‚ and the
answer of the promissor would correspond, Dabo, Frontino, 616]

119. respondeo here in its original and etymologioal signification
[which thus makes a sort of pun].

120. potes, cf. 11 3. 88.-a,mbu1a, cf. 11 3. 92.

 

IV. 3.

2. collos, cf. 11 2, 107.—tegoribus‚ the form of terqorz'lms which
is supported by A in the next scene (7) and again by Bo in
Pseud. 1 2. 64 [defended by Turnebus Advers. xxu ch. 6.]

3-5. Observe the alliteration.

4. absumedo, an ἄπ. λεγ., to repeat the sound of sumen, but
correctly formed on the analogy of uredo, intercapedo.

6. morast, cf. 11 3. 36. For the indic. cf. Trin. v 3. 11, nam si
pro peccatis centum ducat uaeores, parmnst. Poen. ιν 2. 99, nnnc
