118 NOTES. [1v 2, 72—91

72. nominandi istorum copia, for nominandorum ¹istorum or
nominandi ista, doubtless partly to avoid the unpleasant sound
of the former; we must explain the genitive plural istorum as
co—ordinate to nominandi and thus independently and directly
governed on copia. So Ter. Haut. prol. 29, nouarum qui spectandi
faciunt copiam. Another possible explanation of the construction,
i.e. that the governing substantive and the genitive of ’ the gerund
together form a single idea, which then governs the other genitive
case, cannot be applied to the great majority of instances without
violence. The construction occurs not only in Plaut. and Ter„ but

'also in Lucretius (v 1225 poenarum yraue tempus soluendi),
Varro, and several times in Cicero.

74. frustra as a trochee‚ see Intr. A (v).

75. cotidiani uicti, ⁴ every day fare! In the sixth and the greater
part of the seventh century (A.V.C.) the termination of the genitive
of the 4th Decl. was -ί, or sometimes acis. So in Pl. we find only
the forms sumpti, quaesti, tumulti, uicti, yemiti, senati ; the last
occurs even in Cicero.—-adferas. For the subj. cf. 85 J'acz'as.

76. notem, cf. 111 5. 45.

77. tu ne„‘yes you’ 3 cf. Trin. 111 2. 8.
[80. Hiatus in diaeresis]

[81. Hiatus in diaeresis]

[82. propritim. This word is only known to exist in one passage
in Latin literature, Lucr. 11 975, where its meaning is ‘ specifically ¹
‘in particular.' Here the meaning seems to be ‘ specially.' In
MSS. propritim, if written carelessly, would look exceedingly like
proprium. Br. reads propere unum, after Bothe and Lind.]

86. mi equidem esurio, as though Hegio had meant to join
esurire mihi instead of mihi uidere.

88. Te hercle. Erg. begins his sentence as though he were

going to say perdant, but checks himself, and gives it a different
turn.

90. nunc tu mihi places, with reference to the invitation given in
1 2. 66, which he was only half inclined to accept cf. 111 1. 37.

cenam asperam—sero, after the trick played him by the prisonem,
Heg. is in no mood for a feast.

91. Igitur is used by Plaut. and Lucretius to mark with emphasis
the entrance of the apodosis, and may sometimes be translated by
‘then‚' ‘thereupon' Thus Mil. 111 1. 175, quando habebo, iqilur
rationem mearum fabricarum dabo, and Cas. 11 2. 41. So Lucr. 11
677, cetera consimili mentis ratione pet-(tymme (= cum perezqrabis),
inuenies iyz'tur multarum semina rernm, otc. Sometimes we find
z'jitttr joined with tam, as Most. 111 l. 156. Iffl'tnr tum accedam
hunc, quando qnid aqam ‘'nuenaro, and Trin. 111 2. 50.—0lim from
ollas· 01·0lu.s(= ille) means prop. ‘ at that (yon) time.' Here ⁴ earlier,
