¹¹22 NOTES. [v 1. 2—22

V. 1.

2. Quom, see on 1 2. 48.—[redducem, adj. The quantity of the
first syllable of the verb reduco is always long in Plautus, where it

can be determined by the metre. Sometimes the spelling redduco
is preserved in the MSS]

5. istunc, i.e. Stalagmus, whom Philopolemus had found during
his stay in Elis, and had compelled to accompany him home.

7. ex animo, cf. miser ex animo (from the bottom of his heart),
Trin. 11 3. 63 whereas the phrases doleo ab animo, doleo ab oculis, doleo
ab aeyritudz'ne, Cist. 1 l. 61, (literally on the side of the mind, from
the quarter of the eyes, etc.) is a more external description of feel-
ing. After macerauz' the MSS. insert hoc, evidently from the com-
mencement of 9.

9. Hoc agamus, see on 11 3. 84. By Quid nunc Philocr. hints at
his claim to some return.

12. Proinde ut, see 11 2. 57. The reading of the MSS. Immo
potes, Pater, et poteria, et eqo potero ete. creates a false antithesis
between potes¹ and potero, and suppresses the tu which is wanted
for the real contrast of persons.

13. Scan ‘Di eam potestatem,' and see Intr. A (i). [This is an
extreme case, as potestatem is not a combination of words 3 but cf.

use of beneuolens, ‘a welhffisherj Trin. 1 2. 8. [ποθ-ἴνα, however,
might be taken with merito, ‘ by a service on our part.']—muneres
= munereris: a good many verbs, afterwards exclusively Deponent,
are in Plautus used both as Dep. and also in the Active: thus
insectabit 111 4. 61, minitas 111 5. 85, wausffl'cam' (never Dep. in Pl.)
111 5. 1085 so, arbitrarem Pseud. 1v 2. 57, contempla MiL lv 2. 39,
etc.

17. Postulo ς he now openly demands the favour hinted at in 9. —-
reliqueram = reliqui, see on Prol. 17.

4[ll‹‘i³. For the long final syllable of sibi, see Prol. 46, v 2. 19, ν 3.

19. pretium = mercedem, as in Trin. 11 1. 58.—ei, a Spondee or
Iambus, according as eius is taken for a monosyll. or dissyll.

20. Quod bene fecisti <= eius quod), a Relative clause, cf. v 2. 8,
Quod eqo fatear pudeat; v 3. 19, Quod male feci crucior. For similar
instances of the omission of the Demonstr. Pron. see Mil. 1v 2. 86
(quas for wc iis qnas); Amph. 1 l. 296, uon eqo illi obtempero quod
loquitur—[id quod postulas ‘ per appositionem vel epexegesim
