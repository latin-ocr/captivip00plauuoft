1 2. 16—37] NOTES. 83

Lainb. proposed nefiioeis, which would certainly be easier (‘ to pre-
vent your doing so.’)]

[16. cura quae iussi atque abi. These words favour the supposition
that the captives are not on the stage during the whole of the first
aet, as Dombart supposes]

18. uisam 110, 1110 same m» as in uide ne [uide ne sit = perhaps it is,
uide m> mm sv'tzperhaps it is not 3 cf. Cic. pro Cluent. 35 uide 710

turbauit Most. 1v 4. 37, ete—nocte hac. The action of the piece ¹
begins therefore-we morning. ⁴

19. Inde. On tho shortening of the first syll.‚ see Introd. A (v).

[22. conciliare. The mdical meaning is ‘to bring together,’ ‘ unite ;'
hence 1110 two derivate meanings, (l) ‘to fetch' (to bring to a place),
and (2) ‘to procure‚' ‘to buy,’ patrare ,· so conciliem-[sti pulcre Epid.
111 4. 40, ef. Trin. 1v 2. 14.]

23. Vel. . . perpeti, with humorous effect, as he would not himself
be a sufferet thereby.

[26. Fl. and ΒΓ. change the MS. reading 10 miser ccessrc'tmlz'ne. Ι
113νο followed J 3 Scaliger read miser α macritmline, the reading of
B 5 Camerarius misera mcccrz‘tmh‘na]

28. Construe: qnod aliquantillum foris etiam (fusto ‘Only 1110
11101301 11131 Ι still taste away from home) Aliquantulum only in
this place in Plaut. 3 11111 quantillum, tantillum, are common—beat
is stronger than iuuat.

29. Di te bene ament, cf. bene profuerit 11 2. 65. So male formi-
dare (lv 4. 6), male vnmtaere (Aul. 1 1. 22), male odisse (Men. 1 3. 7),
male taedet (Most. 1 4. 4). In these instances the adverbs employed
are of cosmam meaning] to the verbs which they qualify; bene, male =
ualde, uehementer). [Add Lucretius 111 942 quod pereat wude, and
compare his uacuum inane, (Jelz'dae pruinae, calidi uaporis, eto] F 10-
quently the adv. (or adj.) and verb are not only of cognate meaning,
but of cognate form ; hence one of the many kinds of etymological
figures, of which Pl. is so fond 3 cf. 11 l. 57 memoriter meminis-sa ‘to

Whiles it was oum]

37. feras. The suhj. is influenced by 1110 acc. with infin. (me . . .
facere), not directly dependent on qnom; for in Plaut. ‘ quom causale'
is followed by the indicative.
