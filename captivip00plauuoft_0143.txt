Exc'fflescs. 131

writer of the lines wishes to say that in every difficult passage he
has been absolutely faithful to the copy before him, and that he is
competent to the task. The preservation, so characteristic of J, of
the old way of writing enclities and proclities, namely, as part of
the word to which they belong, confirms the belief that these state-
ments are true*

But the faults in these lines make it evident that the MS. is not
the copy made by the composer of them. J cannot claim to be more
than a copy of that copy, and may be even a still later reproduction.
This is a fact which seems altogether to have escaped WVagner. Yet
nothing can be clearer than that qraspicus for 9raphicus, and ad deret
for adderest, are the mistakes of just such an “idiota graphicus” as
the versifier feared to entrust with the task of copying Plautus. The
traces of the carelessness and ignorance of the scribe of J are visible
on every folio of the MS„ which seems often to have been written
with utter disregard of sense and metre—indeed in total indiffer-
enee as to whether the letters put down formed a Latin word or
not. Thus we find such combinatione of letters as inuzmt (1 l. 13)
for uiuunt, to which when written it certainly bears a certain resem-
blance, Ζαηιῖ (i. e. lanum) for lanii (1v 2. 38), Ζῑιόθνίίίῑιε for lubentius
(1 2. 10), & for ex two or three times, uz'tz'lz'tati for uz'lz'lati (11
1. 37), duellares for duellatores (prol. 68), cur aquam for cura quam
(lv 2. 120), and so on in almost every dozen li11es; in 11 3. 54, the
MS. reads Fecisti for Feci, copying the first word of 51, and owing
to a similar mistake it omits altogether a line, Aul. 111 2. 12, which
ends with the same words (caput sentit) as the line before. Many
other instances of such omis-siens, sometimes of one, sometimes of
two, once of four lines (Epid. 1 1. 84 seq.), are quoted by G'o'tz
(Anal. Pl. p. 73 seq.) Again, the marks or conti-actions indicating
a change of speakers are thrown in with the greatest carelessness,
and in such a way as to make the dialogue often quite unintelligible
(see note on p. 17); thus in v 1. 32, it assigns the words Sequere
—z'ntro to Philocrates, making him the speaker and the person
addressed at the same time. All this negligence no doubt rendere
J a less perfect MS. than it would otherwise have been ; but at any
rate we are safe from the hand of a corrector here ; and, as I have
tried to show, there is no reason to suspect it in the first copyist.
The MS. we at present possess is therefore a bad copy of an exact.
copy of a faulty archetype.

In using J we must therefore be prepared to find the text fre-
quently disfigured and distorted ; but we are also entitled to expect
from a MS. of the llth century that it should afford us some real
help in constituting the text; and this, I think, it does. In spite
of the general and marked superiority of Β, J in not a few passages

⁴* Traces of the same spelling are found also in B; see Ritschl, Proleg. Trin.
