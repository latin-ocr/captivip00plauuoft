1 1. 24—38] NOTES. 81

hut Roman names and allusions are not rigidly cxcluded. The Porta
Triqmnina, situated at the northern extremity of the Aventine aud
close to the Tiber, lay directly on the 11110 of traffic between the
Emporium or merchant doek, which was just outside the gate, and
the city. [It is not certain what is the meaning of saccus here ; it
is nowhere (else) applied to a beggar's wallet. N ear the Porta Trig.
there would be plenty of work sor portel-s, and perhaps saccus means
baggage or packages.]—ilicet (i.e. ire licet, cf. 111 1. 9) ad s. ‘let him
lend a hand at porter's work.’

24. rex is the rich patr011; so βασιλεύς 111 Greek eomedy.-—est
potitus hostium, in passive sense (potire ccls'quem alicuius: ‘to put
some one in the power of some person 01· thing’). So in Amph. 1
1. 23 enm nnnc polz'nz'tpater seruitutis. [Potitus hostium occurs twice
again in this play, 1 2. 35, 111 5. 104, and also Epid. iv 1. 7, 39.]

[25-29, a parenthesis ; 25 and 26 seem at first sight to come too
late after the full statements of the Prologue ,· but perhaps the ori-
ginal play opened at this scene without a Prologue]

[26. 1111, a form of illic, often in Plaut„ eg. Capt. 11 2. 73, 91,
Amph. Prol. 133. The MSS. sometimes substitute illic, the better
known word]

[30. Nunc hic occepit. This is not the apodosis to 24, but another
parenthetical remark. The sentence commenced in 24 (Nam post-
quam, etc.) loses itself, and the apodosis demanded by the sense
(nihils-st qno me recipiam) appears as the apodosis of another sen-
tence.

[31. inhonestum quaestum, i.e. as a slave dcaler (cf. 1 2. 20 quae-stum
carcerarimn).]

[33. qui, sce on Prol. 28]

34. nimis quam, ‘excessively 3' cf. Most. 11 2. 78 nimis qnamfiw-
mido. [Cf. miram qnam, mirum qnantum ; the word quam has lost
the sense of a relative 111 these combinations 3 cs. ὑπερφυῶς ὡς.]

35. recipit . . . . recipiam. A play upon words 5 cf. 1 2. 12.

36. sese, only themselves. [In may easily have dropped 0111 before
iuuentute, especially if written in one word, according to the custom
of J. —For the scansion iuuentute see Introd. A (ii).]

37. 1110 demum. He and none but he, ef. v 4. 3, Sall. Cat. 20. 4
Idem velle et idem nolle, ca demum firma amic-iiia esi. [Drmmm
originally of time (‘not till') has passed into the meaning of ‘ only,'
like the German erst.]-—antiquis, cf. Ter. Ad. 111 3. 88 antiqua ulr-
tute ac fide.

[38. gratiis and ingratiis (later forms gyratis, inm-ntis, see Introd. C)
are ablatives derived from [[ναίία, and mean litemlly ‘by favour'
and the opposite. Hence the more special meanings of (1) ‘for no-
thing‘ (Eng. ‘sor loz-(st), and (2) ‘to the hcart's desire, welcome (to
the recipient),’ and their oppositeS. For (1) cf. Capt. 11 3. 48, v l.
