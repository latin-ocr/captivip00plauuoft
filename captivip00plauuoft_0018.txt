protestations of the Parasite at last compel his belief, and he
promises that if the news is true, he will give him free board
for the rest of his life. Meanwhile he bids him pay a visit to
the larder and cellar.

Scene 3. Ergasilus abandons himself to the enchanting pros-
pect of a meal.

Scene 4. An interval must be supposed to have elapsed
between this and the last scene. A young slave recounts the
proceedings of Ergasilus in the larder, and the devastation
that he wrought among the eatables.

Scene 5. Enter Hegio with Philopolemus, Philocrates and
Stalagmus, whom he has fetched from the harbour. Father
and son pour out their gratitude towards Philocrates, and ask
how they can requite him for the honourable performance of
his engagement. He suggests that the devotion of his slave,
Tyndarus, be rewarded ; and now learns for the first time the
punishment which had been inflicted upon him.

Scene 6. Hegio, left alone with the slave Stalagmus, takes
him to task for his offence in carrying off the child Paegnium
twenty years before. Stalagmus, seeing that evasion would be
vain, boldly confesses that he sold the child in Elis to a certain
Theodoromedes for six minae ; Hegio immediately recognizes
the name as that of the father of Philocrates.

Scene 7. At the eager summons os Hegio, Philocrates re-
enters, and Stalagmus is submitted to a cross-examination.
Philocrates at first denies the truth of the story, but when the
slave mentions that in the family of Theodoromedes the child
went by the name of Tyndarus, Philocrates recognizes in his
servant and companion the lost Paegnium.

Scene 8. At this moment Tyndarus, released from the quarry
but still loaded with chains, appears on the stage, and is asto-

longcr time than a few l1‹›urs; and the sanie. nniy bc said os the sull'crings
of Tyndarus. The poet‘s art, then, must hc jndged faulty, not because hc
makes a postulate, bnt because hc gives promincnce to an idea in one
place which is inconsistent with what hc postulates in another. That
the whole action of the play is really continml to a single day may lw
scen by comparing 111 1. 36, 37, 111 2. 2, 1 2. 2 (tho numbers roser to the
ordinary division into live Acts).
