vl. 25-2. 5] ΝοΤΕε, 123

25. Propter meum caput, ‘ for my sake ‘ z capnt = person, person-
ality, sels ; so in 11 1. 36, 111 5. 29, and Pseud. 11 4. 33 (Izoc caput =
eqo), Mil. 111 1. 129 (O lepidum caput), Epid. 111 2. 33, Aul.
111 2. 11 3 espec. in the imprecation Vae capiti two. Even in the
normal usage of later times we find liberum, noxium, uile caput,
and so on.

26. libella, one of the smallest silver coins, equal in value to
one as. — ne duis, see on 11 2. 81.

28. Licet, literally, ‘you have (my) leave,’ hence ‘with all my
heart,' as in Trin. 11 2. 95, 11 4. 116, Amph. 1 3. 46, Men. 1 2. 48 ;
sometimes a mere form of assent, ‘Yes, yes, just so,’ used with a
comical effect in Rud. 1v 6. 4—15.

30. statua, because he stands speechless3 and uerberea, as though
verbera were the material of which the statue was made, see

Pseud. 1v 1. 7.

the usual de], cf. Truc. 1v 3. 25 quid eo ‚reci-sti puero ?, Pseud.
1 1. 86 sed quid ea drachuma facere vis? The Abl. in this con-
struction is simply an Abl. of the Instrument, extended from
things to persons3 sometimes used even with Intrans. verbs, eg.
Trin. 1 2.·120 si qnid eo fuerit (= si quid ei acciderit, εἴ τι πάθοι).

 

V.2

l. bone uir, ‘ fine fellow' ironically as in Mil. 114. 11 (ὠγαθέ),
—The nick name of Stalaqmos (drop) was given by tho
Athenians to a μικρὸν παντελῶς ἀνθρώπιον, see Fragm. of Anax-

andrides in Athen. v1 p. 242 d.

2. quid me oportet, ‘What can you expect me to clo when a man
like you tells such lies‘l’ [Le. as to call me lepidas]

3. frugi ε Corssen (Vol. 1. p. 729 Obs.) takes this as a Dalz've of
purpose (= for use) on the strength of five passages of Plautus, cf.
Truc. 1 1. 13, Cas. 11. 4. 5, Trin. 11 2. 43, Pseud. 1 5. 535 but
Bergk (‘ Auslaut. D im alt. Latein ¹ p. 78 and 98) is more correct in
regarding it as a Genz'tz've (with the loss of a final s, as indeed
Corssen himself had previously thought, Krit. Nachtr„ p. 83),
since Mar. Victor. 1 4. 8 expressly quotes bonae fruffl‘s as well as
bonae fraqi, and even the lover of archaisms‚ Gellius, uses the
form (vi. 11. 2), and must therefore have had authority for it.

4. ne in spem ponas = ne speres, as in metu ponere = metuere in
the senarius quoted by Cic. Top. xm 55, and ad Att. xu 51, xlv
21 ; but ponere (imponere) in aliquid (Acc.) is not unfreq. in

Pla2ut1213: see Trin. 111 3. 11, Mil. 111 3. 54, Rud. ιν 7. 11, Cure.
xv . .

5. Prope modum, ‘pretty well,' as in Trin. 111 l. 14, 111 3. 51,·
