Tyndarus in reply reminds his master that it is he (Tyndarus)
and not Philocrates, that is running the chief risk.

Scene 4 (11 2). Enter Hegio from his house. In the course
01 conversation with the Captives‚ he informs them that his
own son, Philopolemus, is a prisoner of war in Elis, and then
leads the Pseudotyndarus aside in order to ask him some
questions as to the family and position 01 1118 supposed master;
the real Tyndarus looks on and expresses his lively satisfaction
at the skilful acting of Philocrates. The latter tells Hegio that
