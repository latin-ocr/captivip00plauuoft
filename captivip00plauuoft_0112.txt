100 No TES. [11 3. 75—95

[75. Te. Ritschl (Neue Pl. Exc. 1 p. 36) proposed ted in order
to avoid the hiatus. F leck. and Brix bracket the verse as an inter-
polation, the latter on the ground that pro te is meaningless and out
of place 3 see note above, on the whole passage]

[76, 77. The verbs in these lines (duecte, deseras, des) are all sub-
ordinate to quom, and therefore not ‹zo-ordinate with i92207·es,· it was
probably from a misunderstanding of this that atque got introduced
into some of the MSS. for neque, 77.]

[78. This line is considered by Brix to be a gloss, originally writ-
ten in the margin as an explanation of 72, and then incorporated into
the text]

79. This verse is quoted by Nonius (p. 512) as follows : Fac
fidele sisfldelz's, and this would be a thoroughly Plautina turn (cf.
>2'272pudenter impudens Rud. IV 3. 49, misere miser (list. 1v 2. 21, etc.) ;
the MSS. agree in fidelis sis-fideli,⁸ and the adverb fidele (forfide-
Z iter) is not attested by any other example. In another place Nonius
quotes simile est for similis est, misunderstanding similist.

81. hunc, ie. Hegi0.—-inuentum inueni, cf. Cic. Fam. xiv 1. 5 uide
ne puerum perditum perdamus, and the common expression acta
agere. [‘para tibi Heyionem, iam paratum et quaesitum, si officium
tuam faeie-§3³ Lambinus]

183. Obsecro governs both haec and the following subordinate
c ause.

[84. 'I'u hoc age, ‘Mind what Ι say,’ more generally ‘Give me
your attention,' as Hoc (csse, sis, Olympio Cas. 11 6. 49 and Asin. Prol.
1 ; cf. Capt. 111 1. 20. Ι have kept the reading of the MSS. in spite
of the hiatus after tu,· all the changes proposed are unsatisfactory,
e. g. nunc hoc aye (Mffller), followed by erus nunc es,· and the hiatus
may result from the emphasis on the word tem at any rate there are
other passages in which ta in a command stands with hiatus in the
MSS. ; see Asin. 11 2. 112 tu hunc interea ln'c tene, Pseud. 1 1. 31
tu hinc ez eera' cita—tu erus nunc es. Literally true also in a sense
which Hegio did not understand, cf. 671

86. Satin habes, ‘are you content.’—-facta [‘faits accomplis’], cis
Asin. v 2. 63 mandata dicam faeta ut uoluerit.

87 . The first tua is addressed to Hegio, the second to Tyndarus.
Bentley (on Ter. Haut. v 2. 24) makes a remark applicable hele,
‘uoltu et nutet llaec ayntztm·.'—-[ornatus‚ i.e. [astrea-tas, nempe Philo-
polemum reducem-53⁹ Lamb.]

90. eadem opera, see note on 11 2. 43.—syngraphus, ‘ passport.'

92. bene ambulato, ‘bon voyage 1' When one returned, it was
customary to ask ‘benene ambulasti 2² Truc. 11 4. 18.

95. Hosce. The MSS. have hos, but hosce is the proper form before
avowel or h; see F. Schmidtin Hermes V111 pp. 478—487. On the
other hand, we should write levo* bel'orc a consonant, seo Mil. lv 2. 2.
