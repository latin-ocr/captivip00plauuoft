10. [Patri huiusce. Fl. proposes domino patri h.‚ in order to avoid
the hiatus. But compare the exactly similar case in Aul. Prol. 5,
patri avoque, defended by Lachmann on Lucr. 111 941. There scenis
a special reason why huiusce should be made as prominent as possi-
ble (ef. note on Arg. 1), for the person meant is not the same as the
leuius of 4. chp. and Brix. read Huius patri ianitw.]—ja1n h. t. The
same addi-css to the audience, Poen. Prol. 116, Amph. 1 2. 23. [Note
the absence 01 an interrogative particle after {conj—optumumst. The
spectators are supposed to nod assent. [Such falniliarities are quite
in the style of the Prologues ; cf. Men. Prol. 51—55 and again 72 seq.
Even at the present day one may hear 011 1110 Italian stage such a
dialogue as the following :

Actor. Signori, domani sera 01 sara una rappresentazione, intitolata i tre
principi di Salerno ; il primo l'annnazzera il secondo, il secondo l'anunaz-
zera il terzo.

One os the audiente. 11 terzo, chi l’annnazzeral

Actor. L’annnazzcrete voi S'jor Paino ; 0 poi, se ci volete venir, veni-
teci3 se non ci volete venir-accidenti Σ]

11. Negat. On the long syll. -at, see Introd. P, [and comp. Lucr.
11 27 (fulget)].—ultimus, one supposed to have come too late to find
a seat, and to be standing at the back. After accedito we must ima-
gine a short pause; the person addressed showing no signs of obeying,
because he sees no 100111 111 110111, 1110 speaker of the Prologue calls
to him, .ςί non ubi sedeas, sce„ ‘If there is no 100111 101 you to sit
down, there is room 101 you to take a walk (outside).' Est ubi am-
bules is thus an indirect way of saying abi. Similarly Mil. 11 1. 3, 4,

Qui autem ansczclmre rudet, exsut-(ssu foras,
Vt sit, ubi sedeat ille qui auscultare uolt.

Possibly there is a reference to the open promenade (ambulacrum)
attached to every theatre ; 1110 theatrum Pompeii (the first stone
theatro, built BC. 55) possessed one of large dimensions (see 1111030-
101 Τ11001013011ὲ111ᾱο, Tab. 11 12A). [Bentley (011 Ter. Haut. Prol. 31)
proposed to read discedito, considering that accedito was inconsis-
tent with cst ubi ambules ,· but the difficulty may be overcome as

above]

[13. Sense ε you must be off, as otherwise you 10100 1110 actor to
play the beggar, i. e. to solicit from every one present individually
the assurance that he has made himself heard, as the beggar goes
from house to house. Geppert understands mendicarier lstmally, as
though the speaker meant that, if he overstraincd and eracked his
voice, his occupation would be gone. So too Brix.]

14. me ...... 11011 rupturus sum, ‘ I have no intention of craeking my
lungs’ (κεκραγὼς διαῤῥαγὴσομαι), cf. I’oen. 111 l. 37, {aa ευιιεα nanto
noslrorum est -suos rupturus ramices (blood-vessels).
