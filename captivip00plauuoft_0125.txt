was at the same time an appeal for help.

96. Absque in the comic poets is a conjunction (-. si sine), and

[107. mis is an old form of the gen. of eqo, as tis of tu. The

Plaut, but is quoted by Priscian (xiii. ch. 2) from Ennius Parcus
(Lex. Plaut.) mentions it as occurring in our passage 3 and the
omission of mei 111 1110 best MS. (mis being regarded by the copyist
as a mere repetition of the first syll. of miseret) makes this a.
probable emendation: see A. Luchs (Hermes vl. p. 2T4).]
