1 2. 59—70] NOTES. 85

59. In his diebus, ‘within the next few days,’ so Pseud. 1 3. 97
in hoc triduo, with which cf. Ter. Ad. iv 1. 4 triduo hoc, in the same
sense.—reconci]iassere. Old sut. perf. infin. from recena-illuso (asso),
which is a contr. form of reconciliauit-0, and therefore parallel to
reconcilicmer0‚· cf. note on 40.

[60. Has hiatus both in the caesura maior and the caesura minor,
the latter justified by the proper name 3 see on Arg. 1 and Prol. 31.
—eccum, eccum aliquid notat, quod non videtur Taubmann. So Mil.
111 l. 192, where Gruter remarks, ‘eccum non tant-um. dici cle eis qui
in conspecta. snut, sm] etiam qm· 1¹11 ricinia,⁹ and cf. Capt. v 4. 18,
Aul. iv 10. 55. Hegio probably accompanies his words with a ges-
ture, pointing to his house, in which the captives are.]

62. If the reading fore is not corrupt, this is a solitar-y instance in
which it is joined with the acc. cum infin. instead of ut and subj.
(nt mntem). We may find a parallel, however, in Amph. 1 l. 17

quodcumque homini accidit labere, posse retur. See Lachmann on
Lucr. p. 297. ·

64. nusquam. Herc ‘no-wldtherss equivalent to ηοη quoquam ‚-
cf. Cist. 1v 2. 37 hinc nusquam abiit. So usquam, Most. 111 2. 172
equidem Imm] mquam α pedibus absc—mlum tuis. Similarly intas
admits of two meanings5 firstly, rest within3 sccondly, moveinent
‘ from within' (ἔνδοθεν), Men. 1 3. 35 enecate inlu-s Ogllz‘ndrum. Again,
pereqre admits both the idea of motion to and that of 7110tz'0n from,
in addition to its original meaning, (1) in a foreign land3 (2) to a
foreign land, Trin. 1 2. 112 ς (3) from a foreign land, Most. 111 1 79,
Amph. 1 1. 8, 208.

65. The Greeks as well as the Romans celebrated the birthday by

an entertaiument 3 τὰ γενέθλια ἑορτάζειν, natalitiae dapes, Pers. v
1. 16 seq.

[67. facete dictum, ‘capitaL ‘ very good' (lit. cleverly said, cf. 11 2.
26). Hegio had seemed to iinply that he could only hope his invi-
tation to be accepted because it was a special oceasi0n.]—pausillum
with contentus, ‘just a little bit moderate in your cxpectations ;⁷ cf.
wadium. miseri Stich. 11 1. 52, multum. loquat-12⁵ Aul. 11 1. 5, multum
demis-<118 Immo Hor. Sat. 1 3. 57. [Lamb. proposed pausillo, which
would be easier, bnt the MSS. have Aperpcmsz'llamv in the next line t00.]

[68. ne perpausillum modo :dnm modo ne (cf. Ter. Adel. v 3. 49),
‘so long as you don't mean a very little bit.’ Heg. of course meant
by ‘ a little moderate' (pausillum contentus) ‘ considemlssy moderate'
(litotes); and Erg. accommodatos his answer to this sense, ‘Don’t ask
me to be very consiclerably moderate.’ At the same time, when he
says Joerpausz'llnm, he is thinking also of a possible deficiency of
supplies, ‘ a very little dinner,‘ and it is this sense which first strikes
the ean]

69. adsiduo adv. =semper; cf. Amph. 1 l. 14.
70. The sense is: ΗΕ. ‘Come now, state your demand !' En.
