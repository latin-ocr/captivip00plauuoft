proved, on the one hand, by the fact that neither in cases like
cantia& Rud. Π 6. 26, where the accent has retreated from the
short syllable, nor in words like aetas, mores, vincunt, nostros,
where the accent falls on a long, is any shortening of the last
syllable permitted; and, on the other hand, by the fact that
even in abi, tene, tace, the last syllable recovers its length the
moment the pressure of the accent is removed, 1. e. when the
word is pronounced slowly and with emphasis, as is commonly
the 0656, e. g., before a stop: as, veni Men. Ι 3. 32, iub& Capt.
IV 2. &apeme Pseud. 1 1.101‚ Amph. V 1. 61, abac Capt. Π 3. 92,

But the force of 1116 6006111 111 prose, to which the Ictus
Metricus is very often equivalent, makes itself felt even beyond
the limits of iambic words3 for combinations of words forming
an iambus assume the 561116 liberty of degenerating into pyrr-
hics, When a word consisting of one short syllable (quid, quod,
quot, sed, et, is, pol, or, with elision of the last syllable, eqo, abi,
aye, quasi, sibi) is followed by a long syllable With initial vowel
in a word of one, two or more syllables, as qudcl &st Trin.111 2. 4,
itast ibid. 111 2. 42, combinations which have 1116 same effect
on the ear as pdte‘st, &c Thus we find among many instances:

the pronunciation in Elizabethan English i' thre), cibi 1η malam

But the influence of the accent extended not only forwarcls
to 1116 succeeding syllable, but also backzearcls to the preceding
one, so that in words or combinatious of words having the
accent on the third syllable, aud the second syllable long, the
latter was shortened if the first syllable was short, because in
the rapid pronunciation of such words the voice naturally
hurried on to the aecentecl syllable, and, while bringing 11 out
