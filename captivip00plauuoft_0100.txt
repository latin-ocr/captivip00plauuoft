88 NOTES. [11 1. 20—‘44‘

captives most recently purchased at his own house, the rest of them
being at his brother's, hisce must refer to the domestic slaves of
Hegio, who, out of curiosity, we may suppose, were standing about
and watching the strangers.—arbc'trls (witnesses) belongs both to
hisce and uobis.

20. abscedite to the house slaves ; nos to the other lorarii. The
two prisoners thus remain watched from two opposite sides.

[21. incipisse, imperative from 7'12c‘2'122'sso.]

[22. concede huc is addressed to Tyndarus Some commentator-s
have given the verse to Tynd. on the ground that the supposed
master ought to give the command 3 but in 26, it is Phil. who actu-

ally opens the conversation 3 and a great deal of initiative was allowed
to slaves, who were the confidential advisers of their masters]

23. abite ab istis to the two prisoners.— obnoxii, ‘ o '‘red‚’ cf. Trin.
1v 3. 56.

[24. quom, see note on 11 2. lOG.-—quae uolumus, i. e. eorzmzs quaen]

26. nunciam, not nanc φάηι ; the old form of mma was nunes (cf.
nuncine, Ter. Andr. 1v 1. 59), as that of quom was quoni. Num-{mn
is exactly parallel to quoniam, the -czm in either case beingjn ad-

verbial ending, giving an emphasis to the word to which it is attached..
Similarly etium is not from ci, but from an obsolcte eti, allied to ἔτι.

28. neu = et ne, ‘and lest our trick so leak out,’ i. e. if we are ob-
served (the second thing to be gual-ded against is not an independent
alternative of the first) 3 Pseud. 1 3. 103 Ne [llam zcemi'rzs ηνιι me
perflas hominem (mmnfem.——arbitrari‚ ‘observe 5' cf. Aul. lv 1. 21
ltine eqo potero qnid (cy-<cut arbitrarier. ν

30. id, referring in a general manner to doh· ‘ what one is plotting.'

31. si, ‘even though’ the exchange of our dresses has been suc-
cessfully effectcd.

34. For the parataxis, cf. note on 111 2. 5.
35. ero ut, i. e. ‘ you may rely upon me.’—ut, cf. note on 1 2. 11.
36. Nam, i. e. ‘and rightly, sor,’ etc.

37. offerre uilitati, i. e. hold cheap (properly, ‘sacrifice to 0110111)-
ness'), i. e. if Heg. discovers the fraud.

[38. Scio with hiatus, justified by the change of speakers]
39. maxuma pars . . . homines, an apposition instead of the genitive.
40. impetrant, i. e. try to gain.

[43. nunc, cte. i. e. ‘ As I just now (line 35) promised to be as you
would wish 1110 to bc, so now I toll you how I wish you to behave
to me.'——uo10, the indic. for suhj. iu a dependent question, as so osten
in 1‘1.; sce above 14 and 111 4. 25; Aul. 1 1. 7 muln nl [medin]—

[44 is corrupt ; suadeam is perhaps tmccablc to εἰ «valvum in tho
next linc, and mw patri is meaningless]
