104 A‘OTES. [111 2. 1--15

ΙΙΙ. 2.

[1-11, In the arrangement of these lines I have followed Brix,
who has succeeded in reducing them to a system with only one slight
departure from the MSS]

2. bono publico, an ablative of attendant circumstances [‘ to the
public weal,’ as pessimo publieo (Livy 11 1. 3) is ‘ to the detriment of
the public']. It is not quite clear how the public interests have been
forwarded by the purchase of Philocrates ; perhaps Hegio is congra-
tulating both his own country and Elis on the recovery of the tw«)
young men of position, Philocrates and Philopolemus. Lessing trans-
lates, ‘amid general approval 3’ but the words cannot possibly bear
this sense.

3. ubi quisque uident. κατὰ σύνεσιν, as Men. 111 2. 56 satin ut qnem-
qehe conspicor ita me Zudzflcccnt? Pseud. Vv 1. 15 alter ubi alterum . . .
prehendunt, etc.

5. The second syl. of Ita. was originally long (see Corssen 11 p. 454)
and sometimes appears in cretio and bacchiac verse as an iambus.
[The MSS. have retinendoque ,· but qne (q 2) is a very common inter-
polation in MSS„ and it is not at all a violent change to strike it
out.]

7. uix . . . . eminebam z ut nia: eminerem .- paratactically instead of
syntactically, cf. 11 l. 34, and Mil. 1v 2. 57 ita me occursant multae:
Ίηεφηίηίεδθ haud possmn, Men. Ι l. 18, Most. 1 2. 62.

9. The lively movement of the verse, and the short, disconnected
sentences, seem expressive of placid self-satisfaetion.

[13. Praeuortor domum, the reading of J and minor MSS„ must
mean, ‘I make the best of my way home 3’ more literally, ‘before
anything else (as my first care) I turn myself (my steps) homewards‚'
as in Horace (Sat. 1 3. 38), illuc praeuertmmlr ‘let us pay attention
to that point first of all 3² and this corresponds to what Heg. had
said in 11 2. 97 (iam esso aclpareho (ῖιηυί). He does not here say
that he actually returned and entered the house ; instead os that, 119
says he went right on (eo protinus) to his brother's. We should cer-
tainly expect a more explicit statement, that he did not enter the
house; but the apparent inconsisteney between praecum-tor domum
and eo protinus may perhaps be explained as above ; we must allow
something for the garrulous and disconnected style of the old gentle-
mam—Hermann explains praeuertor as praetereo, and Lind. quotes
in support Virg. Aen. 1 317, pravum-(itm- H1›l»·am,· but there the
meaning is ‘ nutstrip‚' and it seems very doubtful whether the word
could mean simply praetereo. Brix and Uss„ taking the reading of
B (reum-tor), regard it as corrupt, and cancel the clause (inde . . . .
renorlor).]

[15—20. Many editors have exerciscd their ingenuity in arranging
these lines 111 a more symmetrical form, but have been driven to
introduce many changes in the text in order to effect this result. 1
